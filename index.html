        Growing up, I consumed black sesame nearly all the time. As the biggest fan of sesame sauce, I need it when eating hot pot,
        and spread it on my bread. And of course, I also eat black sesame soup, black sesame rice balls… But when I first moved to
        the U.S., I was surprised to find that black sesame was not as common as I expected. It was mostly limited to Asian grocery
        stores and a few specialty restaurants.
      </p>

        Black sesame is a traditional Asian ingredient that has been a staple in East Asian cuisines for centuries. It tastes nutty,
        slightly bitter, and popular in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean desserts and beverages.

        However, over the past decade, black sesame has experienced a surge in popularity in the United States, appearing on menus
        across the country in everything from ice cream to lattes to pastries.

          Yelp’s 2026 Food &amp; Drink Trends

        points to notable growth in black sesame matcha (+147%), plus increases in black sesame coffee (+23%),
        black sesame lattes (+23%), and black sesame desserts (+21%). Trendy New York destinations like Bibble &amp; Sip
        are featured for black sesame pastries (almond croissants, bolo buns, cream puffs) and lattes.

      <p>
        But how widespread is this trend really? And are customers actually loving it, or is it more of a novelty?
        I analyzed 698 Yelp reviews mentioning "black sesame" from 2007 to 2022 to uncover the trends, geography, and customer sentiment
        around this intriguing ingredient.
