For starters we had lightly tempura fried Cauliflower Bao Bun that were garnished with a pickled cucumber, carrots and micro greens laid on top of hot sauce! Can you say love at first bit, because that's exactly what it was.
My youngest daughter indulged in the Bubble Waffle. This is a French toast bubble waffle stuffed with guava and cream cheese, served with guava syrup. So beautifully delish, sorry I don't have a picture, just try it!
My oldest daughter and I both had Miso Ramen topped with Ajitama (half-boiled egg in a soy sauce). The Miso paired with carmalized onions, mushrooms,  bamboo shoots and impossible burger were like a symphony playing in my mouth.
The ladies topped their entree's off by sharing dessert. They had the Halo-Halo! It comes in a tall sundae glass and is comprised of shaved ice, condensed milk, ube ice cream,
flan, adzuki beans, black sesame, shaved
coconut, guava candy. So yummy to the tummy!
I topped my Miso Ramen off with So-Shu ( Shōchū ) a distilled smooth beverage that puts you in the mind of light bodied whiskey.
I could have So-Shu as a after dinner drink on most occasions.
Our waiter Huan H. was very polite, easy going and helpful. He makes dining at Ichicoro Ane top notch.

Overall:
Each time, the dining room and the bathrooms have been clean and acceptable.  (I don't understand the absence of a urinal in the men's bathroom.)  The food has been good, not great.  Something is not exactly right with the tofu.  Perhaps it gets old quickly, but generally, the tofu I get here is tougher than I think it should be.

The Food:
On this most recent visit, I ordered the Bangkok Curry with beef.  The meat was good, but just didn't seem right; a little too soft and odd shaped.  I found the dish to be filled with vegetable, black sesame, and noodles (go figure).  I would certainly get this again.

The Service:
I think I primarily dealt with the manager on this last visit, and he was quite accommodating.  He provided my friends and I a complimentary rice krispies treat for dessert.  That was appreciated.  I always like a dessert to settle my meal.

Their produce section is impressive. You can find all kinds of exotic mushrooms here for a fraction of the price of gourmet stores. Oyster mushrooms and enokis are an especially good deal. They also have produce that is just downright difficult to find in other places, like yucca roots and cactus leaves. They have sales on bulk packages of vegetables like cucumbers or tomatillos. 
I buy my tofu here because they often have packages on sale for under a dollar. 
Asian condiments are abundant and cheap. Pick up some sweet chili sauce or black sesame seeds. They have entire aisles of noodles and rice. 
I was a little freaked out by the meat and seafood sections, so if you have a weak stomach, you may want to avoid these parts of the store. I did see a guy buying a live eel, which the sales clerk wrapped (alive!) in shrinkwrap on a styrofoam tray and weighed while still wiggling. Be prepared for sights like these.

This was my first experience with authentic ramen. DH's, too. We had been wanting to check it out for a while but hadn't gotten the chance, so tonight we double dated with our friends M and C and decided it was a good night for ramen. 

It was definitely a good night for ramen. I don't see the whole having to wait outside thing being effective during the summer months, but fortunately it's cool enough now that it isn't a big deal. Tonight, it was cold (well, cold for Tucson, at least). And the line was long, so obviously many people aside from us thought tonight was a good night for ramen. 

There's a pretty good drink selection including wines, Asian craft beers and sodas, as well as soft drinks. The appetizers all looked delicious (hey, I haven't eaten much today) but we opted for the gyoza, which were some of the best I've ever had. M ordered edamame, which came out in a heaping bowl (and we all shared, yum) and C had the pork with bamboo shoots. 

Now the ramen, the most important part. 

Holy smokes. 

I have a child of the 80s fondness for Cup O'Noodles,  as many of us do. I've always drank the broth then eaten the noodles, followed by those vaguely vegetable-like bits of dehydrated corn and carrot. This is not that. 

We got huge bowls filled with delicious broth (DH and I had the black garlic and so should you, just saying), the perfect amount of toppings (fried onions, pickled ginger, black sesame seeds, etc), bamboo shoots, and a piece of pork so delicious and tender that I might write a poem about it later.  And also, if I could make eggs that fantastic, I'd quit my day job. 

It was an awesome experience. Food was great, service was good (I could have used a refill on my drink hence the four stars) and that ramen broth is awfully fun to slurp.

It's a slim, sleek space with comfortable seating and a sushi bar at the end. 

Salad
 
Salad was fairly standard with fresh Romaine. The ginger dressing was clearly freshly made. 

Vampire Bowl [$9]
Spicy tuna tartare, avocado bowl
  
A must order in my mind is the Vampire Bowl, their unique take on tuna tartare. I loved the contrast in textures with the crunch from the tempura and the creaminess of the avocado bowl. The sweet wasabi mayo was balanced by the light heat from the spicy tuna. 

Vegetable Tempura [$5]

The GF's a sucker for veggie tempura and this didn't disappoint. A thin layer of tempura coated mushrooms, sweet potato, and carrots. It came accompanied with a light tempura dipping sauce. 

Beef Negimaki [$6]
Scallion, thin-sliced beef, teriyaki
  
On this trip, the negimaki was a bit disappointing. The beef could have been more thinly sliced and better seasoned, though I appreciated the bite of the scallion amidst the teriyaki glaze. 

Triple Sushi [$25]
Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, tuna roll

The triple sushi featured some of our favorite nigiri rolls, including salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. All very clean-tasting and fresh, the platter also came with a tuna roll. I appreciated that the tuna was whole and not minced within the sushi. 

Uni Sushi [$8]

I was also in the mood for uni so asked for an order of uni sushi. Then again, when am I *not* in the mood for uni? Sourced from California, these were creamy, light, and buttery. 

Bloomingdale Roll [$13]
Spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy kani, spicy yellowtail, spicy shrimp, avocado, longan
  
I was also intrigued by their Bloomingdale specialty roll. The pink seaweed seemed a bit more delicate in texture and taste, supporting the sweetness of the lychee. This contrasted with the subtly spicy mixture of tuna, salmon, crab yellowtail, and shrimp (whoa!). Due to the laundry list of items, the flavors were a bit muddled, but definitely veers toward the sweeter side of a sushi roll. Interesting! 

Sweet Potato Roll [$5]

Of course, we also had to try our standard sweet potato roll. Crazy Sushi has one of the best iterations, with a wonderful juxtaposition of creaminess from the sweet potato and a light crunch on the exterior. The black sesame seeds studding the surrounding rice made for a perfect bite. 

So if you're not looking to go omakase and want a relaxed sushi meal, I'd recommend checking out Crazy Sushi.

We went in and there was one person in front of us waiting and then another 10 or so arrived while they were trying to figure out the reservation and seating.  Maybe it was working out the new restaurant kinks but it took a bit of time to be seated.  We were seated right at the back on the lower level seating.  There's also seating upstairs.

For 3 of us, we decided on the meat lover's dinner for two.  The salad, edamame, and fried chicken karage came out pretty quickly.  The salad was good and we all liked it.  The edamame serving was bigger than I thought it would be.  The karage was fresh, hot and with a crisp to it.  So far, we were enjoying our dinner.

Next, the meat came out.  It was beef except one spicy pork and we also have buttered corn wrapped in foil.  Cooking on the grill was simple and the meats are thinly sliced so it didn't take long to enjoy it.   There was a bit of a break and we thought we were done dinner, but more meats arrived.  The grilled was replaced a few times during our cooking.  The meats didn't need a lot of sauce as it was marinated but there were 3 sauces to select from.  A bit more variety would have been nice.

Perhaps I bear some of the blame for coming here for dinner rather than breakfast/brunch? Maybe I should have began my relationship with M&H by focusing on its strengths? I dunno.

Despite all the fanfare around the opening, I hadn't been in a rush to come to M&H. I'm not the sort to automatically discount chains but I do like to give the local counterparts my initial attention. Add to this the fact that I don't get to The Gulch that often* and M&H fell further and further down my list. But after a night of wondering around the neighborhood, my buddy got hungry and suggested we check it out. He'd been to M&H before and was a fan. So, off we went.

First thing I noticed was the build out. It's impressive. A deft use of indoor/outdoor space, the color black and good lighting makes one want to spend time here. The next thing I noticed: the employees were all really kind. From the gent who showed us to our table, to our waitress, to the manager, to the food runner... everyone was authentically engaging and not nice for nice's sake. It was almost shocking. A sad commentary, I know. Things were headed in a good direction. I pumped the brakes on the vibes by telling my waitress about my tricky gut and gluten issues. I told her it wasn't a huge deal and I would get a salad if a plate of food wasn't an option. She asked the kitchen and came back to tell me about my options. It worked in my favor because my eye was on the Cali Grilled Chicken and it was safe for me to eat!

When the plate arrived at the table... I was disappointed. To my mind, the description didn't live up to the execution. The first disappointment was the presentation. For a plate that reads 'Grilled chicken breast, avocado, sweet potato, brown rice, black sesame, beet, pickled red onion, garlic, kale, feta, white bean purée, carrot, buttermilk cucumber sauce, and chili', I was a bit shocked at how pedestrian everything looked. 'Hospital cafeteria' came to mind. But, the aroma was nice and food is to be eaten, not Instagrammed so I pressed on. I took a bite and... okay. It was okay. Honestly, I found the plate a bit boring and under seasoned. For so many bold flavors (on the page), I didn't understand how 'meh' it tasted in my mouth. Not finding success with the dry components, I mixed everything together and topped the plate with the three accompanying sauces (coconut-chili, another chili and, I think, a lime juice). By then the plate looked *really* unappealing but it tasted better.

Maybe breakfast/brunch is the better call?

Many places try to stand out with creative specialty rolls, but they often try too hard and go overboard. But none of this is the case at Izumi. 

We came in for date night during East Passyunk Restaurant Week, so this review is for that menu. Upon stepping in, there's definitely a very intimate feel with the dim lights, sleek furniture and votive candles. Thankfully, we made a reservation and were seated right away at the bar, which was great because there is zero standing room in this cozy spot (which we overheard someone complain about on the way out). 

For the first course, we chose then crab spring rolls and pork belly starters. The long crab spring rolls were uniquely wrapped in seaweed and then a dough wrapper. They were accompanied by spicy mayo and citrusy avocado sauces. The pork belly was deliciously glazed and flavorful, served atop Japanese risotto that resembled creamy polenta with a couple of sliced mushrooms thrown in. 

Next was a sushi sampling that was well-presented and consisted of tuna dressed in a sauce with like zest, a whitefish (I believe) with a black sesame sauce, and salmon with a sweet foam. The first two were delicious and creative without being over-the-top, while I was not a fan of the overly sweet foam on the salmon. We both agreed that the black sesame was our favorite part. 

The third course is a shrimp and asparagus tempura maki roll with lightly seared salmon and wasabi aioli on top. It's not really fancy, but it really exceeded our expectations. The plump shrimp was cooked well, and the asparagus is a nice touch. We were skeptical of the cooked salmon as part of a roll, but it was sooo good! 

Dessert was a dish of cinnamon sugar donuts and salted caramel dipping sauce. It was kind of an afterthought for me, but it was still good.

I had called before heading to Reno to make sure that the limited 4 flavors were available.  We got there and several people were going in.  We were being polite in our masks/social distancing but a couple families stepped in front of us. No big deal, we can wait.  Got in and able to order.  They only had three flavors and one was vanilla... After making the Ube sundae, we noticed that there was NO CAKE.  Out of cake?! THAT was the deal, fun flavor, cake, topping...  We asked about the cake.  Out of the cake.  ""Do you want a topping"" (that is supposed to go on the cake btw)  Ok.  As an ant walked across the sundae cup, he poured on some evaporated milk, flicking off the ant.  He handed it to us. We paid $5.74 (full price for the cake sundae) for some soft serve, (the soft serve was hollow... you know, not all soft serve - which might be ok if there had been cake inside the void) not the flavor we wanted Black Sesame; without the cake that had and ant flicked off! 
Maybe they could have placed a notice on the door that said NO CAKE and the flavors still in stock. Kind of a waste of time, waiting for others after driving over 40 minutes then disappointment with the no-cake-included treat that we paid full price for",2020-06-04 21:50:06,KRĒM,"115 E Moana Ln, Ste 102",Reno,NV,39.4922712699,-119.7947931411,"Restaurants, Creperies, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Desserts, Patisserie/Cake Shop, Food"

There is a menu from which you select dishes you would like as part of a 7 course meal. If you are (hopefully) dining with another person, then you'll be able to try almost everything on the menu. There are 7 courses, but I was able to try nearly 14 different dishes (!):

- #1 Assorted Appetizers -
I love variety and this ""platter"", if you will, had many distinct items - wagyu beef or pork belly, abalone, fish cakes, fried tofu, and jellyfish. The abalone was very tender and flavorful. Pork belly was unctuous. Fish cakes and tofu were surprisingly good -- great texture and flavor. Fantastic start!

- #2 Soup -
a. Clear soup with egg cake
b. Clear soup with steamed tomato
Both nothing to write home about. More of palate cleanser, I suppose?

- #3 Sashimi -
GORGEOUS presentation. Chef's selection was salmon from Japan (less oily than American), squid, and red snapper (?). The sashimi itself was nice, but not much more. I do very much appreciate the real, grated wasabi though.

- #4 Grilled Dish -
a. Lobster tail with red miso - Pretty good
b. Duck breast - Even better! They marinate this in a delicious sweet soy sauce and the tenderness is unreal. I'm glad they kept the skin on with its fat, because that added a lot to the flavor.

- #5 Steamed Dish -
a. Marinated sweet fish with roe - Awful. The flavor was extremely heavy in terms of its sweetness and smokiness. It was like eating mushy tar.
b. Steamed rock fish simmered in sweet broth - Overly sweet and salty, although quite nice

- #6 Sushi -
Chef's selection: Crab leg, scallop, and Santa Barbara (!) uni
I was expecting more. The crab leg and scallop didn't have much flavor and the uni was good, but I've had better.

- #7 Dessert -
Both desserts came with a wedge of dried persimmon, which we were instructed to eat first
a. Black sesame custard - Not very sweet, had plenty of black sesame flavor
b. Green tea custard - Very nice, wish I had more than a few spoonfuls!

Overall, the good outweighed the bad -- I'd rate it more like 3.5 stars. The food was clearly conceived by a skilled kaiseki chef. Our server was pleasant, helpful, and attentive.

Unrelated to the food/service, but I thought the interior design was strange. It was very Japanese in that it was simple with natural tones, but with Denny's-style hanging lamps over the tables, and an almost anachronous chandelier and ceiling-mounted A/C unit.

For $100, it's a reasonable price for a 7-course meal. Just make sure you don't pick some of the items I mentioned above and you'll have a lovely experience!",2017-01-10 04:23:49,Yoichi's,230 E Victoria St,Santa Barbara,CA,34.4271662,-119.7024792,"Restaurants, Nightlife, Japanese, Bars"

We started off with a special, the tuna meatballs. Those were actually my least favorite; they were cooked, which made them have a fishy taste.

From the raw bar, we did the Shanghai Bund which I could have had a whole plate of. So fresh and who would have thought manchego and raw fish? Amazing! We also did the Sunny D.

We did the Spicy Dan Dan Noodles, which were good! Could have used a little more flavor in them, but still good and the Mama's Dumplings!

If you live in this area and are on a Keto diet and are struggling to find places to eat out... this is the place for you.

I only can recommend it for dinner (I have not been for lunch) where the protein options are all you can eat and there is a large buffet of vegetables, tofu, fish cakes, and noodles (including veggie noodles.) They even have dumplings!!! 
I like the multiple broth options, and I LOVE the huge vegetable and noodle buffet. I wish the pots were larger as mine tend to boil down twice. I also wish the sauce bar had a few more premade sauces maybe a peanut sauce or something a little sweeter. 

Other than that, I love dumping mushrooms, onions, tofu, and shirataki in the vegetarian broth, adding chicken to eat as I go dipped in a sauce made from ground black sesame, soy, sesame oil, and garlic; and finishing the meal with some ramen, sweet potato, or carrot noodles cooked in a very flavorful broth.",2019-06-11 22:51:41,Noboru,117 Garden Golf Blvd,North Wales,PA,40.2344628877,-75.2367362469,"Restaurants, Buffets, Food, Do-It-Yourself Food, Hot Pot, Sushi Bars"

The restaurant is named after the owners two daughters Lulu and Violet. How cute is that?! I came here with my husband for New Year's Eve Dinner. We made reservations the night before. It was a four course dinner for the price of $65 per person and included a 20% gratuity. They offered two seatings, a 6:00 pm and an 8:00 pm seating. We went to the 6 pm seating. We arrived 30 min early as we Uber(ed) and didn't want to be late. They were nice enough to let us in but told us service didn't start until 6. That was nice of them. As 6 pm approached the restaurant started becoming packed as everyone started to arrive. The owner was also working the line with his staff. I love seeing this. He was super cool and friendly. We sat at the bar where he was working on cutting fresh fish. The staff was nice and the food was good.

The dinner on this day was from a pre-fixe menu. What I loved was that everything was served family style throughout the restaurant. Meaning they prepared everyone's dish at once and served each course to everyone at the same time. Although, everyone came with their respective guest and we didn't know one another it felt like a big family dinner. It was nice. 

There was two options for each course and three for dessert. My husband and I ordered the opposite of one another for each course and shared so we could taste everything. We started with some edamame. It was light and yummy. We also had drinks as well. That were tasty. I had the Lady in Pink and my husband had an Old Fashion.  We had Tomato Roasted Garlic Soup and Steamed Egg Custard with Gulf Shrimp for course 1. We shared Raw Scottish Salmon and Sashimi Quality Tuna for course 2. We shared Seared Jumbo Scallops and Beef Short Rib for course 3. Last, we shared the Black Sesame Coconut Ice Cream and the Magnolia Black Tea Ice Cream. All four courses were amazing. The food was fresh and the quality of ingredients was good. This was my first time having raw salmon and I must say chef aced it! I was hesitate at first. However, it did not taste fishy at all.

The Korean fried chick was good as well. We got half soy and half spicy. Nice a crispy and the meat was cooked all the way through. I wish there were more wings but oh well there are other places for that

Kimchi pancake was one of the best I have had. Small and savory. Perfect. 

The beef in the jap chae was dry like beef jerky and also had no flavor at all. The other ingredients in the jap chae were tasty. Lots of veggies. It felt healthy to eat!

The peach panna cotta was light and squishy. Almost jello like consistency and the peaches ere sweet and the oatmeal/granola was nice a crunchy.

I do not enjoy the cake though. It is a bit dry and doesn't really compliment the ice cream in my opinion but that's why I get it without the cake now.

First of all, service has always been great here! The servers and owners always greet their customers upon entrance and also check on them. This place is relatively new and has great potential to grow. Parking is not bad, but the location can be easy to miss because it is located on a heavily trafficked area. 

The place is 5/5 on cleanliness and 5/5 on interior design. They also have a few small board games including UNO, miniature Connect 4 and 2 decks of regular playing cards.

Most importantly the ice cream.
I've gone here three times and so far, all my experiences have been great! I've played around with the menu a lot and I can say I have my favorites down. 
So what to get?
You can get just soft serve if you want with whichever flavor you want. They do switch out flavors though and only four flavors at a time are available. They do have combinations of soft serve, cake and sauce to choose from but you can also customize you're order. So basically pick your ice cream flavor, pick a cake, pick a sauce and you get an option to add pocky for an additional $0.60.

1st visit: I got matcha and ube swirl with vanilla cake and Red bean sauce with cookies n' cream 
2nd visit: I got Black Sesame Ice cream. (Forgot what cake and sauce)
3rd visit: I got pumpkin spice and vanilla swirl with vanilla cake with chocolate ganache and chocolate pocky. My friends got Matcha with vanilla cake and condensed milk with strawberry pocky.

So far my favorite has been my third visit. I enjoyed the pumpkin spice and matcha a lot! Although on every visit, I noticed that the cakes were quite dry. I felt it needed more of a moister cake or more sauce, one or the other. I didn't enjoy the red bean sauce too much becuase it was a little too concentrated for me, but I did enjoy the chocolate ganache a lot! Their matcha soft serve has the perfect concentration of matcha--it isn't too concentrated (which is what I was expecting). I also enjoyed the black sesame soft serve because it wasn't overpowering at all. On my next visit I want to try the Ube-Baby-Baby (I think that's what it was called).

They used to use plastic to put the ice cream and cake in and now they use paper cups. I personally like this better because I can reach for the cake with sauce much faster. I do enjoy the ice cream a lot, but I personally want to eat them all at once. With the plastic ones I had to finish the ice cream first before I got to the cake and sauce.

The idea is simple: Clear plastic cones filled with cake and sauce, topped with a tall swirl of ice cream. Their menu lists four curated options, or you can put together your own custom treat. There are four flavors of ice cream (I think this may change, but on our visit, it was matcha, ube, vanilla, and black sesame), vanilla or chocolate cake, and four sauces: strawberry, chocolate ganache, sweetened condensed milk, and red bean. 

My hubby kept it simple, ordering ""I Love You So Matcha"" off the ""pre-set"" menu. I like to make things complicated, so put together my own: chocolate cake and ganache + ube and black sesame swirl. They offer to add Pocky sticks but I declined....why?! Though they were consistently busy, orders were prepared within no more than five minutes. Conveniently, they are served with a spoon, so you can dig down past the ice cream into the cake and eat it all together. The cake was basic, but good. Fairly moist, with large crumb. My ganache sort of melded into the cake, so it was difficult to try it separately, but nothing tasted artificial, so I'm happy with that. I wasn't sure what my husband would think of the red beans, but he liked them! For the ice cream, matcha is not shy AT ALL - it is green and grassy, and if you love that tea, you'll be all about it. I found it a tad overwhelming for my taste, but again, it was natural, so no complaints. The black sesame ice cream was my favorite. It was sweeter than I imagined, with none of the bitter notes (that I enjoy!) usually accompanying sesame, but it did have good nutty flavor. The color is a stunning dark grey. Ube had no noticeable flavor beyond ""sweet,"" but again, killing it in the color department with that vibrant purple. My one complaint: The ice cream almost hardened on the outside. Not unforgivably icy, but also not luscious and rich, almost like it had a base made entirely of milk or with added water. 

The interior is small, but there is enough seating for 15 or so people. It was clean, with self-serve water available. Employees were sweet as can be. At just under $7 per cone for good, if not stupendous ice cream, just own up to the fact that you want a cool IG photo (can't beat the ""I licked it so it's mine"" neon sign), and you still get a pretty decent dessert out of it, too.",2019-07-10 02:11:28,KRĒM,"115 E Moana Ln, Ste 102",Reno,NV,39.4922712699,-119.7947931411,"Restaurants, Creperies, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Desserts, Patisserie/Cake Shop, Food"

What more can you ask for. Edmonton seems to have exploded in hot pot restaurants, with Asian Express Hot Pot the first to serve individual pots. Then came Urban Shabu by the dim sum owners of Urban China. Not long after, 97 Hot Pot right across the street. If three hot pot restaurants wasn't enough for Edmontonians, two more have opened since my last hot pot review: Bobo Hot Pot (15326 Stony Plain Road) and Chili Hot Pot (7219 - 104 St), and with another Asian Express Hot Pot location on the way! Bonkers.

Anyways! I've been to Urban Shabu numerous times now and have enjoyed all of my visits. I'm going to say I never blogged about it because all my photos were of lamb slices piled over top of each other every time I went out with Joe and his friends. They love lamb. This time around, my dinner dates ordered a good variety of meat cuts, seafood, vegetables, and noodles though so I figured a post was due. 

Individual pots are the way to go. You can keep track of what you put into your soup and not have to worry about what everybody else is doing! I won't lie, there's been times when I've forgotten a thing or two in the pot and by the end of the meal it's more of a guessing game of what it actually was.

My go-to dishes are the handmade mashes and that goes for any hot pot place. It's hard to compare the taste of the mashes when my visits are so far and few in between but Urban Shabu's is still delicious. I don't know why I enjoy sectioning off pieces of mash and watching them expand into balls in my soup pot, but I do. Call me a weirdo. Make sure you section it into pieces though (roughly 3 - 4 pieces per order) or else you'll just get one large lumpy ball of seafood. Other favorites of mine: lamb slices (Joe rubbed off on me!), beef tripe, fried bean curd (unpictured), and mounds of baby bok choy and spinach!

It was a Wednesday night, so service was excellent as the restaurant wasn't jam-packed with people. I've never seen the sauces at the sauce table empty before which leads me to believe they maintain it quite often, refilling the popular ones such as soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and oyster sauce. The best part of Urban Shabu is the concern for the ""post hot pot"" smell. If the restaurant was full, and fifty little pots of soups and spices were boiling away, cooking whatever your heart desired... that steam has to go somewhere. I'll tell you where it goes! It goes into your hair, your skin, your clothes! You can't go anywhere else after hot pot, the shower is your destined location. But with Urban Shabu, it's not so bad. The ventilation is the best of the three restaurants in Chinatown, plus they have purple seat covers for your jackets if you request them. Thumbs up!

Another thing people like about Urban Shabu? Dessert. They offer more than your usual vanilla or strawberry ice cream. They've got sweet tofu pudding, mango creme sweet soup (it's served cold, with tapioca), and a delicious version of longan berry jello (""cake"" on their menu) that won't fall apart on you when you pick it up. Love. They also have Japanese style sesame balls which I haven't tried yet, and green tea or black sesame ice cream.

My personal preference is Urban Shabu and it always has been. I think the clean modern look, clear windows with no condensation, and the way my hair smells afterwards is a big factor. Food wise though, they're all pretty similar. 97 Hot Pot had more of a consistency with how they plate their dishes, especially the meat cuts, making it easier to gauge how many plates to order. I also thought 97 Hot Pot had fresher cuts of meat as well. The mashes, like I said, are hard to compare. Service wise, Urban Shabu does a good job even when it's busy. Some of my friends love 97 Hot Pot though because of their service button, just press it at your table and tada! Help is on the way. If you need a full array of sauces and easy access to them though, Asian Express Hot Pot takes the cake. I believe they're cheaper too? I haven't been there in a while. OH! And Urban Shabu doesn't do half pots, you know, where they split the pot with a divider so you have a spicy side. Best get your sauce concoction down and add some heat there instead. Does it all really matter though? Not really. Hot pot = WIN.",2014-05-22 13:13:02,Urban Shabu,168-9700 105 Ave,Edmonton,AB,53.5486954,-113.4887666,"Chinese, Soup, Hot Pot, Restaurants"

This is a chain restaurant specializing in the Japanese yakiniku dining experience, however, you do have to cook all the meats yourself. It's not an all you can eat restaurant, so to really get full, you end up having to order a lot of meat, or a lot of side dishes. Perhaps the restaurant was over hyped and I had very high expectations, but it definitely hasn't been something I've been craving or wanting to go back for.

First we started off with the Spicy Cold Tofu, Spicy Cabbage Salad, and Steamed Chili Dumplings. All three of these dishes pretty much had the same flavour profile topped with a lot of crunchy garlic. Although it was very tasty, I felt like we were eating the same dish over and over again.

Next up was the Fried Bacon Chips and Fried Chicken Karaage. Both dishes were nice and crispy. Fried to a perfect golden brown. Nothing bad to say about these dishes, but nothing that really impressed me either. We also tried the Shrimp Garlic Noodles that everyone has been raving about. Best dish of the night, but was still lacking in umami and garlic flavour.

We then moved onto the BBQ meats. We ordered the Harami Skirt Steak, Kalbi Short Rib, Toro Beef, Pork Toro, and Duck Breast. The meat was all well marinated and tender. However, because you are cooking it yourself, you have to be very attentive as all the cuts are very thin, and you risk overcooking them!

Lastly, we finished off with Taiyaki Pancake, and Frosty Tropic Sorbet. Be careful not to burn the Taiyaki pancake! You end up having to flip it every 10 seconds. Flavour was good and it came with a choice of green tea or black sesame ice cream. The sorbet was nice and refreshing. Great way to end the meal. 

I did really like the ventilation system they have. You don't end up leaving smelling like BBQ meats all night!

The inside is so pretty and well decorated, and I love the location! It's so so so close to my condo, and traders Joe's where I shop.

So after mom and I went to traders we squeezed in during the last 30 minutes till close, and they were totally cool about it. I recognized the owner from the carson location in the back.

The rolls omg just that perfect thin layer to cover but not over shadow the seaweed and fish, stick and sweet and tangy (rice white vinegar and sugar, held together seamlessly on all the rolls.

Mom ordered the Fuji and said the raw fish was some of the freshest she has had anywhere local, including minatio and hinko. The shrimp inside had a lovely crunch with out being too oily.

I order three rolls and loved the presentation on all of them as well as the spicy level.

The cici with no salmon (they were totally cool about it too) had wicked hot white sauce on it spicier than sriracha, but I loved it!!! The scallops were super fresh and the other tangy sauce paired nicely with the ripe avocado and the cream cheese was a needed to balance out the spice level. 

The moon dog poppers had crunch jalapeño with the seeds taken out so it was much less spicy than the other roll, paired well with spicy crab and a crispy tempura case, and cream cheese filled innards.

Then the two next rolls were sooooo artistically done both my mom and I were taken back. Plated on craved wood the sauce designs were truly magical as you can see in the pictures!!! 

The volcano had the delicately fried out side, and was pipping hot, with the soft eggy sweet tamago inside and huge sweet scallops on top with a spice sauce and sauce all around the plate to drag through. 

The samurai was prob my fav. The huge chunks of pecans were such a lovely bit of nutty texture, to the cream cheese and fluffy fried shrimp, topped with again huge chunky scallops and black sesame seeds with 2 creamy spice sauces. Then again plated like a a piece from a museum!!

The inside is so pretty and well decorated, and I love the location! It's so so so close to my condo, and traders Joe's where I shop.

So after mom and I went to traders we squeezed in during the last 30 minutes till close, and they were totally cool about it. I recognized the owner from the carson location in the back.

The rolls omg just that perfect thin layer to cover but not over shadow the seaweed and fish, stick and sweet and tangy (rice white vinegar and sugar, held together seamlessly on all the rolls.

Mom ordered the Fuji and said the raw fish was some of the freshest she has had anywhere local, including minatio and hinko. The shrimp inside had a lovely crunch with out being too oily.

The tapas\sushi conveyor belt idea is fun and interesting. All of the bubble saucer plates, shouts from the cooks, ""Yo Yo"", put us into sensory overload. If you are an indecisive person this is not the restaurant for you. The plates of sushi and other dishes swirl at  a fast pace. I grabbed at least 2 plates on impulse. Bring a calculator because each plate is a different price based on color. For example the green plate is 3 dollars and the yellow plate is 7 dollars ( I wonder if color blind people pay more because of this). Breakdown of some of items  that I tried:

Iced Green Tea: Matcha based, excellent quality, and free refils: 5/5
California Roll (purple plate): Average flavor not real crab I have had better at most resturants: 2/5
Black Sesame Dorayaki (purple plate) Love the raspberry sauce, great sesame flavor, ate 2 plates: 5/5
Chicken Fire Cracker Rice (orange plate): Decent well seasoned, not spicy, not much chicken: 3.5/5
Chicken Katsu (orange plate): Solid choice, good sauce, fair portion: 4/5

In the future I will avoid the sushi and order more hot entrees. I enjoyed most of the chicken dishes. For lunch with tip my wife and I payed just under $50.00 dollars and were still hungry.

About a year ago, I came here & left disappointed because they were closed for 5 days while I was here around Thanksgiving time--which was understandable & forgivable.

Luckily, this time we showed up during summer since the kids had just finished school & I wanted to take them out to enjoy a few days of good eating.

We showed up around 6 PM on Monday, June 10th, and the place was actually pretty quiet.  I expected it to be a lot busier considering it was 93-degrees out, but I was fine with not having to fight the crowd.

The 3 kids got almost exactly the same thing, the matcha/vanilla, while my other nephew got the ube & I went with the ube/black sesame.

I really wanted to give this place a 5-star review since the people here are very friendly & accommodating.

The place is small, but clean and still felt comfortable with the table arrangements.  I love the cute set up, especially their Instagram wall.

The kids really enjoyed their dessert & I liked mine too, but I wish it was a little less sweet & a little creamier.  It didn't really taste like soft serve ice cream, more of a sorbet texture, which I wouldn't mind if it was more of a fruity flavor.

Portion seemed much bigger than I expected so I couldn't finish the whole thing, even with my daughter's help.

The kids had a nice time hanging out there playing Uno for about an hour.

We'll definitely be back in the future.",2019-06-13 08:35:10,KRĒM,"115 E Moana Ln, Ste 102",Reno,NV,39.4922712699,-119.7947931411,"Restaurants, Creperies, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Desserts, Patisserie/Cake Shop, Food"

It's taken a while to get here, as our pups' vet and groomers are located in this strip center, but this will certainly be in our regular rotation.

After checking out the reviews on Yelp! I scanned the pix for the menu, as the website doesn't list ingredients.  I placed the order online Monday for a Tuesday afternoon pickup (pups at the groomers).  Ordered the chicken and the beef/Guinness pot pie as well as a beef/mushroom and pork/yam empanada.  Super easy to do, just remember that the pies are usually made fresh and take about an hour...so keep that in mind...perfection takes time!!).  Without fail, the pups were done 2 hours early, so called to see if we could move the order up.  They said they had the chicken ready, but the beef/Guinness would take about an hour.  So they offered the Gumbo in exchange, which they had ready for inventory.  The empanadas only take about 8 minutes to make.  That worked great for us.

The place is set up for take out only, though there are picnic tables set up that are shared with another eatery.  You walk into the place and you are hit by the savory smells of fresh baking pies (they should make a candle in this scent!!).  Very helpful, friendly staff and had my order ready to go in minutes.  Had to ask how to reheat non-frozen pies (300 degrees for about 30 minutes, though a meat thermometer is highly suggested, as the pies are fully cooked and just need to be heated to serving temperature).  Smelled so good in the car they almost didn't make it home!

Unless your ravenous, the pies are easily sharable, as are the empanadas.  These are real pot pies, with flakey, buttery crust encasing the fillings.  We had the chicken pot pie along with the beef/mushroom empanada.  More than enough for the 2 of us for dinner.  After popping them in the oven for around 20 minutes, they were hot and ready.  The pot pie filling was absolutely delicious, complimented by the savory crust.  Filled with onions, carrots, celery, corn, peas and lots of chicken.  The beef/mushroom empanada is encased in a black sesame dough, filled with beef, mushrooms and peas in a dark savory gravy.  Again, perfect size for dinner...though I could have easily overeaten, it was soooo gooood!!!

We'll have the other pie and empanada for dinner tonight.  2 dinners for under $30 with the taste of homemade.  Yeah, we'll be back to try the other items.

My timing was perfect since I was able to catch the Japanese Festival.  However, I was really tired and just wanted to check-in without dealing with airport parking, etc.  After reading some reviews, I opted to park temporarily in the 15 minute space to see whether my Gold membership got me some perks.

CHECK-IN AND PARKING ****
$10 for 24hr parking but Gold membership got me $5 for parking.  Someone on Yelp mentioned getting free parking but I don't mind the $5 discount.  The front parking gate card reader was denying access after front desk programmed my room keys.  I tried the back parking gate reader as well with same problem.  At least the back parking lot had a speaker button which dialed to front desk so that they could open the gate for me.  

Front desk searched a bit for room upgrade.  Eventually, she found corner king suite with 2 rooms- separate bedroom and living room.  YESSS!!! I overheard the guest checkin a few minutes later looking for similar room.  Beat him to the room within minutes.  The front desk also got me free fountain drink voucher, appetizer voucher, and breakfast buffet voucher.  ALL THREE- THE TRIFECTA!!!

KING SUITE ****
Missing Peter Thomas Roth body wash so called room service.  Got 2 bottles within minutes from housekeeping.  Great view of the airport from both bedroom and living room.  Dropped off my luggage and went downstairs for quick bite to eat.

RESTAURANT ****
I had a ginger ale with Ahi tuna seared with black sesame seed crusted.  Quick and wonderful service.  Would have liked to try local brew but voucher only good for non-alcoholic drinks.

SWIMMING POOL ****
Yes, there were many families but loved the 9ft deep end to go for dives.  Housekeeping was there to stock up on towels for us.  I did a couple of laps and then headed to room for the night.

FITNESS CENTER ****
Woke up early to get a workout in.  Found the stairmaster similar to the one in the Double Tree Chesterfield.  Got my 30 minutes in before a morning shower followed by breakfast buffet.

BREAKFAST BUFFET ****
Got an omelet made to order at the grill.  The rest of the buffet was wonderful with plenty of fruit.  I also found small boxes of almond milk and chose the chocolate flavor.  I also found a nice spread of smoked salmon but didn't want to risk it.  The coffee was quite bitter.  Overall, I loved this hotel which reminded me alot of George Clooney's ""Air Up There"".

The register is located at the back of the store, which is pretty confusing. You have to pay for your order, then wait for them to call your name, instead of waiting in a line. The staff has to go around shouting your name and searching around the store for you in order to start making your ice cream, which is pretty inefficient. We waited over 30 minutes before being called...I do appreciate the unique Asian flavors this place offers such as Thai tea, taro, and black sesame. The decor and music was nice. It's not the best ambiance to hang out in as it is super loud from all the chopping. The place cod just use more structure and organization. They also have two boards with the ice cream flavors, but nothing displaying the toppings, so it took everyone a lot of time asking the staff every time. The ice cream is on the pricey side, $8. It was tasty, but a bit unnecessary chopping. I've been to several rolling ice cream places where they smash the toppings into the ice cream, but instead this place just adds it on top. Lastly, the spoons were not durable at all. It kept bending every time you would try and scoop up your ice cream.

I am glad I listened to my fellow Yelpers and continued inside because the food experience was remarkable!  The restaurant outside is deceptive as to the food that you'll experience inside; the interior has dark wood booths, three chef's tables and a bar in a separate area and is low lit at night with it's red glass hanging lights and strung mini Italian lights. There is a small section for nightly entertainment as well, and tonight we enjoyed the music of a very talented piano player who upon request played ""our song"" In My Life.  He had a good voice and played a variety of music.  Our server, Alyssa, was warm and friendly and made good suggestions of what to try on the menu.  She provided very good service and allowed us to leisurely enjoy our meal.  We ordered sangrias upon being greeted...him the house, me the chai. Refreshing and fruity.  Chill is all about small plates and sharing. Not your typical tapas, Chill's portions are plentiful for small plates. There is a wide variety of choices from salad, soups, cheeses, pasta, seafood and meat. We sat at one of the chef's table and watched the chefs in action.  The chefs, Steve and Paul, create fantastic food that can compare to any upscale restaurant in my hometown Chicago. Beautifully presented, the food at Chill is incredible. We started with the goat cheese tapenade terrine, goat cheese layered with sundried tomatoes, figs and olives finished with a sherry reduction and served with crostini.  Very tasty.  Next, we had the roasted stuffed dates, which were the size of a golf ball, filled with Gorgonzola and wrapped in prosciutto then roasted and served on wilted spinach with a blue cheese drizzle and a balsamic glaze. An explosion of gooey goodness in my mouth!  I've never tasted stuffed dates better than these...sorry Meson Sabika.  Then we had the ahi tuna, encrusted with white and black sesame seeds and seared to perfection. This sushi grade tuna was served rare and came with a wasabi cream, ginger and a yummy seaweed salad.  Next we enjoyed the margherita flatbread, a crispy thin flatbread topped with tomatoes, garlic, mozzarella, basil leaves and pesto. I loved the texture of the crust layered with flavors against the melted cheese...yum. We were full at this point but the danger of watching the chefs in action meant we had to try just one more plate....so we had the Kobe beef sliders.  Kobe beef topped with Gorgonzola mousse, mushrooms, port wine reduction on a pretzel roll and served with rutabaga fries.  What??  I would never eat a fry again if I could find these yummy vege fries on other menus. By the way, the sliders were ahhhmazing!  I cannot say enough good things about this wonderful little restaurant.

We also each had a $4 beer off of the Center City Sips draft specials - the Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold and the River Horse Roly Poly Pils. Both were solid beers on the lighter side.

To eat, we shared the Potato Croquettes and Korean Style Fried Tofu. The croquettes were slightly crispy on the outside and pillowy soft on the inside. The chipotle aioli served with them was amazing - I don't know how they were able to achieve something so mayo-like with no dairy or eggs, but it was addicting.

I've been here for drinks before, but a bunch of friends and I decided to go one night for dinner this past weekend.  We were fortunate enough to grab a table on Open Table and I highly recommend you make reservations if you want to dine here so that you don't have to wait a long time.

I was super excited to try the food here, as I've thoroughly enjoyed the drinks (4-stars for them).  It's a great cocktail spot, and as much as it pains me to say it, their food did not do it for me.  I wanted to like it so bad, but it was either bland and tasteless, some of the flavors just didn't work, or the texture was completely off/weird.

If you're into smoky drinks, definitely get the penicillin - comes with smoky candied ginger pieces on it too!

Spring Rolls - three long spring rolls served with this chunky sauce (the chunks are said to be pineapple, based on the menu, but it tasted more like apricot).  The spring rolls barely had any filling in them and honestly, tasted just like regular spring rolls from a Thai or Chinese restaurant.  The sweet potato was completely drowned out by the shell and tofu.  The sauce is also difficult to use because it's extremely chunky - you need a spoon to essentially spread it on, you can't dip it.

Smoked Cauliflower - complete MISS.  Now, it was my fault for going in thinking these were either going to be fried or similar to a smoky Korean bbq style, but it was neither - pieces of cauliflower that were brushed with some burnt smoky flavor.  The raisins and pine nuts are nice compliments with the smokiness of this dish, but you would taste the burnt flavor on the first bite, but the cauliflower is so hearty, that you then just taste dry raw cauliflower immediately after.  These either need to be smoked for longer, or soaked in something.

Avocado Toast - this was pretty good.  The bread was crispy and charred, so everything would fall apart when I'd try to take a bite.  There's real slices of avocado on it, which is slightly different than what I've been used to.  The habanero mayo is a really tasty touch. Definitely worth trying.

Bao Bun - my favorite!  This little sandwich was delicious!  The bun was delicious and melted in your mouth...it was slightly sweet, which was a perfect combo with the strong bbq taste from the sandwich.  This was savory and a bit too salty for a few of my friends.  Highly recommend this dish!

Crab Cake - personally, I didn't like the texture of this dish at all.  It was very stringy zucchini, and I guess they're trying to resemble actual crab cake (one of my friends who isn't vegetarian mentioned that this is the closest resemblance of crab cake she's ever seen), so if you're into that, go for it.  I wasn't.

Korean Fried Tofu - this was definitely my 2nd favorite dish.  I was quite shocked it was tofu when I took my first bite because the tofu was very heavy and firm...almost paneer-like texture, which I don't mind at all.  The sauce was sweet and spicy, with black sesame seeds.  It was very good, but I think it needs to eaten with something - rice or noodles - for it to be complete.  Also, I don't think the term 'bbq' quite describes it, as it wasn't really barbecued, but more fried with this darker sauce.

Overall, we at least enjoyed ourselves and it's always fun to try new places.

The cafe was clean and modern, with excellent decor, tantalizing pictures of food, and bright colors abound. I ordered a sesame egg waffle (only $2.75!), grabbed a table, and watched the young server behind the counter make the waffle right in front of me. 

She looked bored and angsty, so I smiled and commented on her demeanor. After a couple of exchanges, she asked if I knew Chinese. Yes, both Mandarin and Cantonese! Turns out her sour service earlier was simply due to a long day and inhibited conversation with English-speaking folks. She transformed from a sour waitress to a bubbly expressive one once the language barrier was removed! (So, 4 stars for service.)
 
The sesame waffle was handed over to me wrapped in wax paper in a brown paper bag. It smelled amazing. I didn't know how to eat it so I ripped off the bulbs in the waffle one by one. (Whereas normal square waffles have pockets, these have the opposite -- they bulge out.) The inside was fluffy, soft, and sweet, and infused with black sesame. It was heaven.

Look on the walls across from the counter for three delightful paintings of Chinese cooks in the act of preparing pizza, noodles, and stir-fried vegetables. I don't see art featuring Asian-Americans much, so I asked to take pictures of them to save.

Took a menu with me to go. Everything was translated into perfect English. I can't wait to be back to try the green tea waffle, shaved ice, and the kimchi rice.

Take whatever trend is happening in LA and 5 years later it will make its way to Santa Barbara.  We finally have a Thai ice cream place here and the business was booming.  Its a little like coldstone creamery.  They mix a cup of ice cream base and your choice of flavor on a super cold piece of metal, flatten it out, and chisel/push it off the surface with a metal spatula so it looks like giant chocolate shavings.  They have some unique Asian flavors that you don't see in McConnells or Ben and Jerry's such as Thai tea, taro, and black sesame.  

I got the Thai tea, which needed to be stronger in tea flavor.  Kids got the oreo and cream (good and basic) and banana and nutella (very fresh banana flavor).  Each ice cream came with 3 free toppings.  I liked the chewy mini mochi, pocky sticks, and the fresh fruit toppings.  There were also chocolate chips, m&m, sprinkles, oreo, gummy bears, etc.  

There were quite a few stations to make the rolled ice cream, but despite the numbers of employees, the wait was still very long because each order was made to order.  I can think of three small changes to make the ordering process less chaotic.  First, have a sign direct patrons to the cashier or place the cashier right by the front entrance.  Second, turn down the party music by a notch or two.  I wasn't the only one who couldn't hear my name being called.  Third, instead of copy off Starbucks and call customers by name, just assign a number instead.

Really - I have nothing bad to say about Copia.  I went for a work lunch and was pretty excited since I'd hard good things about it and never went before the fire destroyed it a while back.  We walked in and my eyes grew to the size of saucers - the bar/ restaurant is beautiful!  From the glass waterfall separating the bar area from the rest of the restaurant to the beautiful tiling used throughout to the gorgeous light fixtures, I almost forgot I was there to eat.  (Blame my having an Interior Design degree.)

We were then led out back to the stunning wine garden.  It was like being transported to a relaxing, tropical resort given the retractable roof, soothing fountain in the middle of the patio, and being surrounded by palm trees and Hibiscus plants!   So relaxing.

Our server was extremely nice and helpful with tips about what was good to eat there.  And lucky us - the Executive Chef Dave Rook was there that day and had just whipped up a new lunch special - beef tenderloin on baked ciabatta bread with cheese and veggies and some sort of delicious sauce on top.  And apparently when the chef whips up a special, it's best to try it as you won't be disappointed.  My two co-workers both had it and were very happy with their choice!

I had the Goat Cheese Salad - BEST. SALAD. EVER.  Mixed greens, roasted chicken, sweet onions, sliced strawberries tossed in a cracked pepper berry vinaigrette and topped with a ball of warm 
sesame-encrusted goat cheese.  Oh, heaven in a bowl.  I about licked my plate clean, it was that good - and it was under $9!  You can't beat that.

Copia seems to have a great variety of lunch and dinner items, all which have interesting food combinations.  I can't wait to go back and try the Flash Fried Calamari, Spicy Mango Chicken Pizza, Grilled Chicken Lasagna, or Black Sesame Seared Ahi.  And I can't ignore their abundant wine selection, either.

The storefront is tucked away in the outer corner of the small shopping complex off of Whyte Avenue, a complex that I've always refer to as ""the one where Dream Tea House"" is. To Korean fare fans, SFC takes place of the old Lee House. Chef Jake Lee is a part of the famous Lee family, now in Chinatown.

It was a packed house on both of my visits. With mostly tables for two and a single table for six, it's the one thing missing from SFC: seating. Since Lee House's closure, they've cut the dining room almost in half in order to expand the small kitchen area. Definitely designed for some quick drinks and eats. 

SFC OG: Golden crispy, moist and seasoned to the bone. This really is the OG (original gangster). The batter is noticeably crispy and the meat tender and moist. As a base for all the chicken made at SFC, this is a must order on your first visit.

SFC BBQ: Dad's famous Korean spicy BBQ sauce. Between my friends and I, we all remember Lee House's sauce to taste a bit different. Jake explained that although the sauce is the same, the technique is different: his dad wok-frying the chicken instead. Jake wanted a crispier chicken, with little potential to become soggy from sauce. Definitely accomplished that, a soggy piece of chicken not in sight while we were there although somehow not as memorable as his father's. OG Mr. Lee takes this one, sorry Jake! Most notably, SFC's BBQ sauce is quite gochujang-strong, whereas I prefer a spicy-sweet combination instead.

Onion Lover: Sweet hot mustard topped with shredded green onion. It sounds so deceivingly simple, the words ""hot mustard"" really throwing me off. This became one of our most memorable flavours and one of the best. The ""hot mustard"" is actually based of what Jake calls a ""yellow wasabi"", only found in Korean markets. It's also one of the most popular fried chicken flavours in Korea right now. I can see why. Addictively sweet and hot. I'm not even a mustard lover to begin with!

Cilantro Lime: SFC OG basted with cilantro lime chimichurri. Deliciously bright from the lime, I appreciated a different flavour profile on the menu! Something tells me that the word ""chimichurri"" on the menu would come from somebody who has a culinary background and not just ""in the family business"" kind of experience. Sure enough, Jake told us that he's worked at XIX (Terwillegar) before starting SFC. 

Garlic Soy: SFC OG basted with soy sauce and garlic. Basted is a loose terminology, it was doused in a soy glaze! Looking for something salty and messy to eat? This is your kind of fried chicken!

Golden Kari: SFC OG basted Japanese curry powder. Much like the Onion Lover, I would have thought this was my least favourite flavour from just looking at the menu. 'Lo and behold, it ended up being one of my favourites! Japanese curry lovers, you'll need to get this. Nay-sayers, get this too because I think it will surprise you in the best way possible!

You can order Half Chicken (10pc) for $13-14.50 depending on the flavour, or a Whole Chicken (20pc) for $23-27, which is enough to feed 4. Best deal: the 5pc Chicken SET ($11) for your choice of single flavour, any 1/2 order of salad, & your choice of house fries or corn fritter, & can of pop. SAYWHAA? Sides not your thing? Then get the 5pc Chicken + Domestic Beer ($10.50). Pay the additional $0.75 and upgrade to import.

The cold Mac n' Cheese Pesto salad was creative and delicious, but the Sesame Potato Slaw has my vote: a shredded potato, cabbage, and yam slaw mixed with a black sesame dressing. That dressing is killer. House Fries appear to be fresh cut, done well (slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside) although nothing noteworthy.

And as if you're not full enough (and I'm not writing enough), there's dessert. The ""Almost Famous"" Walnut Red Bean Cake Pops - 10, 15, or 20 pc ($5/7.25/9.25) is made fresh daily and in limited supply. Commonly eaten on the streets of Seoul, I remembered these to be deliciously hot, nutty, and slightly sweet from the red bean paste inside. Saturday's visit gave us a soft, chewy dough with a delicious red bean paste with bites of walnuts. On my 2nd visit, Jake told us that they had changed their recipe to make a firmer dough, a style more in tune with how it's made back in Korea. I personally preferred the chewy texture but to each their own! The one thing I really had hoped for when I saw the machine behind the till was that it was made fresh to order! The Vanilla Coconut Chia Pudding ($4) that I took home later to try was delicious, thick in consistency and full of coconut flavour. I don't think desserts is really needed on the menu, but it's there if you've got a strong hankering for it.

So with that said, I want to go back... and again and again. I had sushi rolls that I have never heard of or thought could be possible.

As far as the other sushi items are concerned, my mouth was also full of heaven. I like that they have more than just 'rolls'. I like the squares. I am a sushi lover, not a sushi snob, so I don't really know the proper term for these items, but they were so good! Everything was fresh and full of flavor. I wish I had a pen and a notepad with me so I could have written them all down, but I just remember that there were so many varieties that I was thanking the sushi Gods. I know that I enjoyed their Spicy Tuna, then there was a tuna with smoked sesame seeds, a Spicy Scallop item and then there was one that just blew my mind that I had to share it with my non-sushi eating awesome friend who treated me to this lunch. It was salmon, but it was so smoky and full of flavor. It was one of those bricks/squares and man oh man was it good. I guess he liked it. He ate mostly meat (he's a man! grrrr..)

So onto the non-sushi items. I have to say that there's none of that regular Chinese buffet crap there (fried this, greasy that). Everything seemed/looked healthy. I went along the side with all of the salads. I tried the black sesame salad with mushrooms (very different; had a weird fishy taste), a soba noodle salad (delicious! I love Soba Noodles!) and the eggplant (I wish I would have taken more). I was disappointed that the calamari salad was all gone and angry at myself (no, I'm not at all dramatic) that I didn't go back after a while to see if they filled it up. I had some of this fried chicken... little wings, full of meat and bursting with flavor. Just the right amount of spice with some sweetness. My friend detected a peanut flavor going on there with the wings. I did have 2 pieces of tempura (onion ring and shrimp) that lacked flavor. No big deal. I wasn't there for the tempura :) I also tried some Udon soup. This was my first time having it. It was full of flavor, but I didn't really know what to ask to have put in it, so I just asked for tempura shrimp and green onions. I wish they had more choices to go in the Udon soup, but again, no biggie!

Now onto the Green Tea Ice Cream. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This stuff was seriously good!!! I am so glad that I didn't make a pig out of myself and overload on food so I was able to have room for the Green Tea Ice Cream. This was the first time for me and all I can say is that I want some more. 

Overall, dining at Minado was a positive experience. Waiters were friendly, staff were friendly. The bathroom was clean, as was the dining area. The only gripe that I have is that when I was ready to leave I started taking pics of the sushi items and the head Chef told me I couldn't take pics of the food. I explained to him that I was a first timer there and I was going to review Minado on yelp. I even said,""Yelp! Y - E - L - P."" He smiled, said this time okay, next time no pictures. I just stopped it right there. 

Seriously, though, if I could afford to eat here weekly, I would. It was all that I had expected and more, even without much expectations!

I will be going back for SURE! Wow, what a place! I feel like I can give birth to a baby squid! LOL*

Owned and operated by Horizons' former Sous Chef, Ross Olchvary, Sprig & Vine is truly an amazing dining experience. 

Our party of 4 was greeted with a warm welcome by their host and we had arrived just after the big dinner slam, so we were promptly seated.

The entire restaurant was glowing with warm ambient light shining from very unique cork light fixtures suspended from the ceiling. After being seated, you can't help but feel absorbed by all of complimentary natural earth tones and the independent track list. 

Our server immediately greeted us with a smile and opened our bottle of wine and poured everyone a glass.

We started with the Fried Baby Artichokes, Edamame Falafel and Tofu Satay....all amazing. You almost feel guilty as your fork disturbs the pristine presentation of each dish, but the flavors and textures are truly out of this world. 

Ever have black sesame tahini? i certainly hadn't. The edamame falafel was delicately placed ontop of light drizzles of the tahini. It was perfect and garnished with pickled radish.

the tofu satay was accompanied by pickled mango and had an amazing coconut-peanut glaze.

We ordered every entree except for the cornmeal-crusted tempeh (only because we were a party of 4 and not 5).

The slow roasted root vegetable pave was like a sunburst on my plate. Featuring local soft polenta, red wine braised shallots, and grilled asparagus, you forget that what you're eating is ""100% Vegetarian"". You forget because it's kind of hard to believe that such complex flavor is the result of purely vegetarian ingredients.

We also tried the Cauliflower Three Ways, Seared Coconut Risotto Cakes and the Moroccan Grilled Tofu. We had to try one of the side dishes, so we went with the Kennebec Potato Fries.

I really can not say enough wonderful things about Sprig & Vine. After 3 bowls of soup, 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, one side, one dessert and 2 cups of coffee, our bill was only $122 dollars!!!!!!

In the past, i've  paid literally triple this amount for half the quality!

Bring a bottle or two of wine, bring your friends, but also try bringing someone who has never had the opporutnity/privilege to try an all out vegetarian/vegan experience. it will totally change their perspective on food.

Whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, or all out carnivore, do your taste buds and spirit a big favor and stop by Sprig & Vine for a wonderful and reasonably priced dining experience brought to you by a true artisan.",2010-04-25 18:11:23,Sprig & Vine,450 Union Square Dr,New Hope,PA,40.3652421073,-74.9540627003,"Vegan, Vegetarian, Restaurants"

I was pleased to see how big and clean this place was as my expectation was to see old table and chairs, dirty buffet table, overcooked food, small selection and poor service.

We arrived before 5 pm on a weeknight and there were already a few people there.  The food looked freshly made, there were two soups...hot n sour and of course wonton.  The wonton was the usual, there was fried rice, chow mein, shanghai noodle and singapore rice noodles but there wasn't lots of meat with these.  For meat there was sweet and sour pork, lemon chicken, ginger beef, chinese style bbq chicken, pork dumplings, spring rolls, breaded fish, chicken balls and breaded shrimp. There was salad but who really eats salad with chinese food?  Dessert choices were different flavour jello, cake and fruit.  I was hoping for the warm soup type dessert like the red bean or black sesame.

All this was only $16.95, better than the other western chinese buffets.  The waitresses came by frequently to clear plates and refill drinks.

The decor is really modern and the chairs are so comfortable! I've been to some new places lately *cough* heritage *cough* that have seats that cause your butt to go numb before your appetizers hit the table! 

We started with the salmon roll appetizer, it came with three pieces which was perfect for us. The salmon was perfectly smoked and it was filled with cheese and topped with a jalapeño, delicious.

For dinner my cousin and I had the salmon dinner (we like our fish!) The dish came with a small heirloom tomato salad and some purple sticky rice with a beurre blanc sauce. Everything on the plate was cooked perfectly and the flavor of the salmon was buttery and smooth, melt in your mouth!

My boyfriend ordered the burger they had that night, it had kimchi and a sweet plum ketchup and on the side it had tempura battered sweet potatoes. When the burger came out it looked pretty plain, but my boyfriend said it was seasoned so well it made his top 3 burger list! Plus he ordered it medium rare and it actually came out that way! 

Lastly (we were hungry!!) we decided on a berry sake soup for desert. All I can say about that is wow! I love fruit in my champagne but there is never enough of it, this dish was like a bowl of all that fruit! There was a quenelle of cream in the center with black sesame seeds, the sake was sparkling a little, the raspberries brought a little bit of tartness... it really hit the spot! 

My only small complaint was that the menu we had seemed to have less options than the ones pictured here, but that may be because we went on a weekday.

It kind of adds to the mystery of the place!

Inside, you'll find the floors, the walls, the ceiling is covered matte black. When you pass by on the street, you're intrigued! But as soon as you walk in, the art deco vibe they have going on actually wasn't executed very well. I just felt they were trying too hard to look cool. The space is pretty large, however. It's three floors. The basement was also a mystery, but there is additional seating on the third floor, which is lofted. High ceilings, dark, but still added greenery near the window. The chairs were pretty comfortable actually.

The food itself is a mixed bag. We ordered the crudites, which were fine. They are cooked slightly, and still maintain a snap and crunch which is great! But the avocado mousse that accompanied them was a little bland. I ordered the scallops which come with 3 large sea scallops over a bed of succotash and diced ham. The plate was dotted with a sriracha type sauce and something that looked like black sesame sauce (not sure if that's what that was). It was good and filling. I would highly recommend this dish. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon. It was meh. It looks like they use sous vide to cook the steak, which is great because it came out perfectly cooked, but it didn't have that crust or seer that makes a steak great. They cover the ""aerated"" potato, which was a potato skin with what resembled a cheesy, creamy potato filling, with slices of truffle - which looked amazing, but felt cheap, honestly, after you take the first bite. I've had dishes that contain less truffle but the aroma and truffle flavor just fills the whole dish. This was covered with slices of truffle and I could barely make out the truffle flavor - which makes me wonder if it's a real truffle or where they got it from. Check my pictures - the potato was literally covered with truffle slices and yet the plate was only $30. Something didn't add up. 

I will say that the staff was attentive and I never felt like I was waiting for anything. It wasn't exceptional service, but it was good. 

My general thoughts of the place is that they are trying too hard to fit a certain category of restaurant. Everything was simply ""alright"" and nothing really stands out, which was disappointing.",2018-08-02 19:47:12,Talk,2121 Walnut St,Philadelphia,PA,39.9510946,-75.1765402,"Nightlife, Bars, American (New), Cocktail Bars, Restaurants"

I particularly enjoyed the black sesame soy drink--it reminded me of the black sesame soft serve that I like to get in Japan.

The black sesame was a very delicious complement to the elegantly delicate soy milk, and the drink had a very pleasant nutty flavor. If I were to mention something that could be improved, it would be that when the drink was served, it wasn't as steaming hot as I would have liked it to be.

I always get super excited when I discover a new Asian restaurant. And ShangHai1 offers both Shanghai and Taiwanese food. 
I went there on my lunch break to order take out, and the menu was a bit overwhelming. Even though the staff were very helpful, still I was confused. 
I ended up getting the scallion pancakes, Shanghai style udon and sesame rice balls.

The tender beef scallion pancakes were crispy and surprisingly sweet. As I expected, the shanghai style Udon was pretty good. Two thumbs up for the stir-fried chewy and thick noodles with baby bok choy, shiitake mushrooms and chicken in dark soy sauce. Wow, simple, delicious and became one of my favorites.

My meal is never complete without dessert, that being said, getting the sesame rice ball with chinese wine was a big mistake. I opened my dessert container, and the thick and viscous translucent broth-like, that killed my appetite!!!  Challenged, I processed exploring the mystery of my container. I just had to.

Jason Licker, acclaimed pastry chef, Iron Chef Thailand Pastry Champion 2014, and James Beard Award Nominee, was doing a dessert pop-up tour, with a short stop in Reno. We had to check this out. 

I'm not normally the type to order dessert regularly, but when I have an opportunity to try some dishes that I've never heard of or seen before, I'm down.

I have to start by saying that I was immediately impressed with the service of Liberty, well before we even arrived. 

We had reservations for 4, on a busy Saturday night, and at the eleventh hour, emergency struck. We had written off our dining experience for the evening. I called Liberty and explained the situation, and I believe Michael may have been with whom I spoke. He was very super understanding. I mentioned that we were really looking forward to this, and he offered to extend our reservation for a later time. Jackpot. 

 After all was well, a few hours later, we arrived. The space is downtown, and right across the street from a parking garage, which makes access much less of a headache. The place was popping. Tons of people were out dining and there was a good energy about the spot.

We were seated, and the good service continued. Being 6'5"", I occasionally come across seating limitations, as you can imagine. The hostess was super sweet, and quickly located me a comfy office chair. Brilliant! It was a great way to begin the evening.

We started with some wine, of course. The ladies had a tasting flight, while I started with some Prosecco. We knew we would be ordering every single dessert, so we skipped appetizers. 

I really wanted to try the Chef's Pasta they had going on, which I ordered, only to then be told they had run out of ingredients to make it. Mild disappointment. However, it gave the the excuse to order the Chef's Fish. 

Diver Scallops. Ginger & Chile Lime Asparagus. Crispy Pork Belly. Cauliflower Purée. And a Meyer Lemon Pesto.

It was actually really tasty. The Pesto added a lovely acidic element that really tied the other flavors together. 

My friend ordered the Rigatoni. Coming from a big Italian family, I'm often skeptical of ordering pasta anywhere but my own kitchen... however, as much as I love the Scallops, I wished I had ordered the Rigatoni immediately after tasting it. The Ragu that dressed the pasta had a depth of flavor that you can only achieve with a LOT of time and tender, loving care. It was phenomenal. I made sure only to have one generous bite so I could properly enjoy the wonderful plate of food that I had.

The desserts. I'll attach a picture of the menu and inspiration for each that was included. Jason Licker did some serious work. I checked out his Instagram prior to going and saw all the work that just went into the garnish of one of the desserts. Super impressive. Also, while going to wash my hands I happened to recognize him, and said hello. I could tell he was incredibly busy, right in the middle of service.

Matcha Tart was very interesting. I hadn't ever tasted something like it. It's something he's known for. The green tea and chocolate produced a flavor that went really well with the rich, chocolate ice cream that came with it. The green color of the Tart was just incredible.

The other desserts were all very good, with the berry Crème Brûlée being my favorite of the five desserts we had. It's an iconic French masterpiece, but Jason layered it with a raspberry-yuzu gel under the custard, that was perfection. I've never had a multi-layered Brûlée before, and it was tremendous. Definitely had more of that than the others.

The best component of any dish however, was the shiso gelee that was apart of the White Chocolate-Junmai Sake Cream dessert. That was an explosion of flavor that enhanced all of the different sweet, salty, sour acidic going on. Truly remarkable. 

The Chocolate Bar we felt may have been better if eaten alone, but it was soooooooo rich that it blew out your palette if you ate it before anything else. It was well done. Just really intense.

Finally, the Mandarin & Black Sesame was insane. So gorgeous. I actually watch a short video of Jason making this and all the layers that went into it on his Instagram, and it didn't disappoint. Another unique dish I've never experienced before. The nutty flavor isn't something you can really compare it to except for itself. It was light, full of citrus and fat, all balanced very well. It was great.

Towards the end of the evening, Jason saw me at the table and came over and said hello to everyone and took a selfie with me. He's a super nice guy. That definitely helped make the night that much more memorable.

However, if you order from this place like it is your typical sushi restaurant, you will be sorely disappointed. That was our first and only mistake. The basic rolls are nothing special. You can find those at any place in town. We also got some basic udon. But I think we recovered nicely.

Being the big eaters that we are and out for a birthday, we decided to splurge. We added on the salmon 6 ways and we were very happy with the dish. First, it's displayed beautifully. The waiter basically said we were not allowed to use soy sauce on that dish. Each slice of salmon was dressed differently with subtle but sophisticated differences in flavor that would be masked by soy sauce (I rarely use soy sauce with good fish anyways). We finished it off with green tea ice cream and black sesame ice cream. These desserts do not have a lot of sugar. You can really taste the green tea and black sesame.

We would have tried the omakase meal but it was sold out. The waiter said that they get their fish straight from the Tokyo market, so when they run out, they are really out. I think the shipments come in every two days. We happened to be there on the third day. So we will have to try this out another time.

I, however, came here with my girls for #SIPS, and it was hands down one of the best happy hours I've encountered in the city.

You should know off the bat that this restaurant is completely plant based. As an avid carnivore, I can say, I was completely thrilled with the variety and flavor of every item I tried. There's a good mix of small plates offered at happy hour. We sampled the Charred Shishito Peppers with Romesco Sauce (red peppers and nuts), Potato Croquettes, Zucchini ""Crabcake"" Sliders, and Korean Style Fried Tofu, all washed down with the Red Sparrow cocktail. My favorite dish was the potato croquettes with chipotle aioli - it was like a lightly fried ball of the creamiest mashed potatoes, a mashed potato truffle if you will. Honestly, I'd drink a cocktail made with that chipotle aioli. DELICIOUS. 

My least fav was the Korean Style Fried Tofu, and my three friends agreed. It was spicier than I anticipated, and while the texture was perfect, there seemed to be a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Maybe it was the black sesame seeds. Either way, I wouldn't order it again. 

Our server was funny and tolerant of our goofy giggles. He was fairly attentive to our table, but you could tell he was busy, given the time and day. 

Huge fan of this place. I am super keen to come back and try more menu items. I'd avoid coming here with parties larger than four, as it's a narrow, tight little restaurant.

Started on with an appetizer. Great gyoza with a sweet and sour taste sauce, slight vinegar with the saltiness coming from the dumpling itself.  

Let the food speak for itself and it did, amazing, comparable to any of the top ramen places I've ate at. 

I'm mostly impressed by the Iekei broth, intensely deep, with a strong fragrance of that garlic and black sesame. Noodles were al dente, just how I like them, good sized portions. The egg was cooked to perfection, yolk inside wasn't runny, but very creamy yolk that won't drip and ruin the broth, great medium. I went on a tangent about an egg, but it was amazing, trust me. Now back to the broth, very rich, as advertised on the menu, it was chicken and pork broth, and I'd never had this mix before. After trying it, I think the umami from this combination is a force to be reckoned with!

Last night, a few great friends took me to their special six-course Chinese New Year dinner. My friend had the reservation for nearly two months, and it was one of the best meals I've had in Reno

2019 is the Year of the Pig according to the Chinese zodiac. With that consideration, the First Course was a perfect beginning.

First Course: Tofu Skin Seafood Roll & Roasted Pork Belly.  

It was served with a drizzle of an equally sweet and savory sauce on the plate. 

The pork belly was succulent and mostly melted in your mouth. The top cap was rendered quite a bit and achieved a very crispy/crunchy texture. 

Tofu skin is now one of my new favorite ingredients. The texture was lightly crisp on top and was juicy, but not greasy. The filling was a mixture of calamari, shrimp, and some vegetables and herbs. It was phenomenal.

Second Course: Five Spice Sea Bass & Snow Peas.

This was my favorite dish of the night. The fish was perfectly cooked, enveloped in an incredibly thin batter. It was delicate, well seasoned, and packed with flavor. On top of the sea bass were some finely chopped jalapeño, which may have been pickled; they didn't have that heat component you normally associate with jalapeño, and was a great complement to the dish. Snow peas were super fresh, and added a wonderful texture variation to the dish.

Third Course: Soy Sauce Shrimp with Ginger Scallion Noodles.

The chef changed up the menu slightly, switching the garnish of the shrimp and lamb courses. I'm glad that he did. The shrimp were served with the shells on both ends, for a beautiful presentation, and were delicious. The soy sauce shrimp sauce wasn't what I was expecting, it had a little sweetness to it, that really made the shrimp pop. The ginger scallion noodles were wonderful, eaten by itself and also with the shrimp. The ginger wasn't very powerful at all, and added a nice subtle flavor to an overall tasty plate of food.

Forth Course: Hainan Chicken Rice.

This dish is poached chicken and a seasoned rice. It isn't something you often see on menus in the US. The Hainan Chicken Rice gets it's name from it's origins in the Hainan province in southern China, but it was when the Chinese brought the dish to Singapore that it became famous. 

Absolutely the most flavorful chicken I've ever had. It was juicy, and the rice was cooked perfectly.

The rice and chicken are both well seasoned mostly with salt, green onion, and ginger. It's a dish I would encourage you to try when you have the opportunity.

Fifth Course: Grilled Lamb Chops & Snow Pea Tips.

The final course before dessert was some of the best lamb chops I've had. They were very lightly marinated, which resulted in a delectable caramelization. The snow pea tips were much like chard, beautiful sautéed greens; everyone at the table felt they were one of the best components on any dish.

Sixth Course: Steamed Egg Custard Bun with a Chinese Egg Tart.

The custard bun was something unlike anything else I've ever tasted. It was round, and had the texture of the most soft dough you can imagine. It was coated in a peanut butter powder, and inside was delicious black sesame. It wasn't too sweet, and was a great new experience. The egg tart was very light and creamy, and topped with fruit. The sweetness mostly came from the mango, pineapple, strawberry, and blueberry. Each bite was unique, depending on which fruit you ate with it. I couldn't think of a better finishing dish after a magnificent meal.

In regards to the wine, we started with a cold, crisp Prosecco. Then moved on to a robust Pinot Noir that bursts with cherry, strawberry, and plum flavors with a slightly sweetness that's moderated on the finish with rounded tannins, and finally an unapologetically bold, spice-driven and jammy Zinfandel. 

All of the wine paired really well and elevated the overall experience. The Pinot and the Zinfandel being the favorites.

Danny is the one that runs Kwok's Bistro, and he's a really good guy and often displays a contagious smile. 

Winnie, our server, was an absolute delight. She's very friendly, outgoing, and has great energy and sense of humor, referring to her name as in ""Winnie the Pooh!"" Winnie made the evening that much more memorable.

One of the best birthdays I've had, with the best people, and some of the best food in our big little city. I feel extremely lucky to have gotten a seat during their New Years celebration.

Kwok's Bistro is definitely deserving of this fifth star, by every measure.",2019-02-19 20:39:25,Kwok's Bistro,275 West St,Reno,NV,39.52747,-119.81646,"Noodles, Restaurants, Chinese, Asian Fusion"

Thirty five (35) minutes from paying to receiving said product. Only four (4) numbers between me and my turn once paid for. This seems a little long to be waiting on a cool, slow night for ice cream. I knew ahead of time that there would be a wait; still was disappointed. I couldn't imagine the wait on a hot summer night. 

As for the product, mine bland (black sesame); wife's flavorful (oreo & cream). Texture wasn't that of ice cream or gelato or popsicle but rather shaved ice.

Came in on a Thursday evening and this place was so disorganized. With 1 person on food prep, 1 person on drinks and 2 waitresses, it was a complete downhill experience from here. Luckily we got our order taken quite promptly, but we watched others who were not so lucky walk out of this place after being left unattended for 10-15mins. 

We ended up ordering the American style hot chocolate after being told the black sesame hot cocoa was discontinued. We also opted for the double triple chocolate fondue. We waited around 20 mins for our fondue to arrive and boy oh boy.. The waffle was undercooked and cold in the middle and tasted like raw dough. We ended up telling one of the waitress and she completely panicked, apologized and said that they were receiving similar complaints the whole night. (Interestingly enough, the table next to us also complained about the undercooked waffle before us as we were being seated). We were approached by another waitress, who said they would be replacing the waffle and giving us a discount for the inconvenience. We ended up getting a replacement waffle with the same results. By then, we gave up and just ate the fruits and left the waffles as is. 

The interior is really cute and it's such a shame this location is so disorganized and understaffed. I wish the desserts at this place was better. To be honest, I wouldn't pay $20 on fondue to eat cut fruits and undercooked waffles. We ended up getting a 15% discount for the fondue which wasn't worth it. I felt bad for the one staff who was running around making all the food by himself and the other waitresses trying to keep up with all the tables.

The broths are still the same and delicious as ever, without really needing any additional sauces. However, because it has become an ACYE, they have cut back on some of the food that you can request, specifically in regards to meat. Nonetheless, it is still great (we love the pork belly and the hand sliced fatty beef). Over at the self-serve bar, they have a ton of vegetables, seafood, and other add-ins (tofu, sausages, quail eggs, etc.) They even have a little station with dumplings and fried rice (try not to fill yourself up on rice!! you're paying for the meat and seafood!). 

Their service is okay, they have a panel on the table that has a red side for when you need assistance (water, fill up your broth, order more meat) and a green side when nothing is needed. However, sometimes our red side would be up for a little bit and they would not come as quickly as we would like and our broth would reduce a bit too much. Also, some of our vegetables were dirty! Make sure that you are checking some of the vegetables before placing them in your broth.

I've been eating Chinese bao for a long time... probably ever since my baby teeth came in. So I was very familiar with the food, but I knew that The BAO puts a twist on the traditional bao. I wasn't sure what to expect or whether or not I would like it.

For appetizers, my spouse and I split the Taiwanese Dumplings, which were perfectly pan fried and very tasty. I probably could've eaten mulitple orders of these for dinner and I'd be happy. For the bao, I had the Soft Shell Crab. I really enjoyed the bao, pretty typical fried soft shell crab, nothing special in my book. I did like how the sweetness of the bread and mayo balanced out the bitterness of the arugula. I also had a bite of the Truffle Shroom bao, which was HUGE and really good. The gouda went well stuffed in the panko crusted portabello. For dessert, we had the black sesame ice cream bao. This was basically a small donut cut in half with ice cream in the middle.

The space fits 12 seats, but they are currently only serving 10 for 2 services a night. Reservations are highly coveted! They announce when reservations open on their Facebook. So make sure you are on top of it! From what E told me, their menu is pretty much set each month. 

I had 2 appetizers. Edamame and his fish broth with mixed mushrooms and octopus. 6 courses of fish, 2 pieces per course. According to the menu, you get between 6 to 8 courses of fish. I wish I was lucky enough to have gotten a 7th or 8th piece. Even without it, I left full and satisfied. The last dish was Chef Kaz's homemade black sesame ice cream. 

Apparently, the 830 time slot will be a little bit more lax and you may order extra bites and drinks if you want since they aren't in a rush to serve another group afterwards. Even though I came to the 6pm time slot, I never once felt rushed.

With limited time in St. Louis and the choice between Niche and Sidney Street Café an impossible one we made the only responsible decision available and opted to visit both on the same night, originally planning to enjoy Robert Zugmaier's desserts immediately following Gerard Craft's cuisine at Niche - a plan slightly augmented by the rapidity and small portions of Niche thus allowing us plenty of time to and appetite to also enjoy savories prior to dessert at Sidney Street Café.

Located just down the street from Niche and small from the outside but much larger within our arrival at Sidney Street Café preceded the reservation by nearly 45 minutes but from the moment we arrived we were treated like old friends, first by the maitre d and then by our server, Elissa, who went over the chalkboard of specials detailing each dish and easily convincing me to order more than I would/should have with her exquisite descriptions.  A heavily wooded restaurant with exposed brick walls and dim lighting I will note that on a Saturday night Sidney Street was quite boisterous - almost ""bar like"" in its atmosphere, but service was professional and the kitchen impeccably timed, every dish coming out at appropriate temperature, execution, and interval.

Moving on to the food itself, I will simply say that while the execution at Niche was excellent, the food at Sidney Street Café spoke to me much more loudly - a menu of personal favorite savories and proteins all executed in unique ways; the gnocchi a bubbling stew served in a cast iron pot and absolutely perfect in texture when matched with the soldiers (and the sauce sopped up with the buttery table bread) and the Foie Gras one of the better preparations I had in 2012 - at once sweet and savory, creamy and crunchy, hot and cold.

Further onward to the desserts - the original impetus for our visit - suffice it to say that if you live in or visit St. Louis and don't experience Robert's desserts you are making a mistake every bit as egregious as missing the Arch or the Missouri Botanical Gardens.  Beautiful, bold, and complex I'd be hard pressed to say which of the three selections was 'best' since each was quite different but as overplayed as the concept is the deconstructed Snicker's was truly outstanding - the variations of each ingredient contributing to the whole and that sorbet something I'd love to see served in a scoop shop anywhere and a reason in itself to visit Sidney Street Café...and possibly even the city of St. Louis.",2013-04-06 17:50:53,Sidney Street Cafe,2000 Sidney St,Saint Louis,MO,38.603495,-90.2177833,"Nightlife, Bars, Wine Bars, Soup, Restaurants, American (New)"

Thanks to the baking entrepreneur Tommy, I found my taste buds singing Britney Spear's song ""Gimme More"" whilst masticating on Mochi Doughnuts for the first time. The shiny, iridescent doughnut box instantaneously transported me to a club with disco balls and LED lights.

For those who are a Mochi Doughnut Newbie like myself, imagine a doughnut with a slightly chewy, stretchy interior texture of gum or gelatin. Then add on unique, fun flavored frosting and toppings for variety.

Today I experienced these four flavors (in order of my favorites):
- Guava: Fruit-forward, tropical, slightly tart, tangy
- Pumpkin Cheesecake: Instantaneous Autumn warmth within, cinnamon, pumpkin butter finger-lickin' goodness, explosion of textures with crunchy bits
- Black Sesame: Smoky, nutty, ground pepper, hint of strawberry on the finish
- Strawberry: Fruity-tootie bubblegum, reminiscent of one's childhood, crunchy sprinkles to top it off

Here's the down-low on how Mōr Doughnuts Pop-Up ordering works:
- Four flavors of doughnuts are posted on the website weekly.
- Online pre-orders open up right at 12pm (noon) on Thursdays. Only a limited batch of 25 boxes are made.
- Choose how many four pack boxes you want, pay with a credit card, and select your pick-up time.
- Show up at either 10 or 11 am on Saturday or Sunday (by 1pm at the latest!), provide proof of identification, drive away, and enjoy!
- Doesn't get any more Covid-friendly than that!

A few tips:
- For freshness, eat sooner rather than later. If they need to sit for some time (particularly in a warm car), leave the cover cracked or open to avoid them from getting hard or crusty.
- Sorry picky eaters, you can't pick and choose your doughnut flavors (as of now). They simply come in a variety pack. I hope to find Mōr Doughnuts at a local cafe soon.

She seated us in their outdoor, covered wine garden which was quite nice, the ambiance of being outdoors but without the street-noise and bustle of many outdoor venues.

We began our meal with a couple of starters, a stuffed portabello mushroom and some flash-fried calamari, both very good.

That said, after trying TAP for lunch today I can say that the food was bland and uninspiring for both my friend and I. She ordered the drunken noodles with chicken. The noodles were undercooked, ridiculously long, and unevenly coated with the thick, mostly flavorless brown sauce. Not a trace of wok hei to be tasted (the 'sizzling wok' flavor imbued into properly cooked wok dishes.) There wasn't even a pleasant spiciness to the dish.

I had the green papaya salad with coconut rice. Or at least, that's what the menu called it. Really, the rice was more like white rice with some coconut cream on it, and a few black sesame seeds. The green papaya salad was basically just shaved papaya and some julienned carrot. No peanut, hardly any chili, no tomato, and only a couple of long beans in a basic lime dressing. A sad excuse for an $12 meal, which came to $14.73 after tax and tip. Only the dried chili I asked for on the side saved it for me.

While the bathrooms are gender neutral (win!), the interior is sleek, and there is a patio space which we took advantage of to catch a few rays of winter sun, none of these made up for the lackluster chow. @Lily Z. mentioned that the branch on Upper State is like ""Thai food for people who don't want too much spice and flavors.""

I get that and I have much grace for that. However, it is still important to at least *try* to bring your A-game. When the kitchen backs up and food is taking long because a world-wide pandemic has drained people from resources and food and their souls, I will smile, be patient, exclaim all the, ""I totally understands"" as I can muster  and I won't judge *at all*. But when one makes a reservation for a very busy Saturday night to bring an out of town vegetarian for an amazing meal, one hopes that the start of the evening would be appropriately accommodating (I definitely don't need overly accommodating). This was not my experience at Charlie was a Sinner. We walked into a busy restaurant for our outside-dining reservation a few minutes late because the most beautiful weather had landed on Philadelphia and it was the last big weekend of summer and the city was poppin and our 5- minute late arrival was due to very crowded streets as we made our way to the restaurant . I masked up, approached the hostess stand and heard a party of 4 get turned away because they failed to make a reservation. I was glad I knew to make sure I called for a table a week prior and hopeful about the ease of which we would be shown our reserved table. Once I checked in, the hostess told me to wait outside and she would show us to our table. Perfect. We found our place to stand to try to stay out of the fray of the busy sidewalk and servers and I was encouraged to see the empty four top just waiting for diners. I was more than 90 percent sure it would be where we would enjoy our food. But as the hostess came and went out of the door with a few glances our way, I began to doubt myself. Could be for someone else because of COURSE we wouldn't just be standing here for more than 15 minutes if that empty table belonged to US and our 7:00 reservation. Right? I became even more doubtful as I saw her stand and chat and laugh and swap stories with a couple that was standing near the door of the restaurant. This is when I became really curious as to what exactly was happening. It's crowded, tables are in demand, there is an empty one waiting yet we stand while this young woman continues to catch my eye a few times but goes back to her lively exchange with her friends. Remember I'm patient? And forgiving? And truly don't expect special treatment? (All true!) But when she finally made her way over to us (almost 20 minutes later) she  gestured to the empty table and instructed, "" You may have a seat at this table.""  What?? THIS table? This empty table that I had my eye on since we stood to wait almost 20 minutes ago? I couldn't help my surprise. I sort of looked at her sideways, chuckled and said, ""THIS is our table?"" She appeared a bit put off. ""Yes,"" she said as if standing right in front of it for twenty minutes while she chatted with other guests was the most appropriate thing to do. There was tension and so as we sat she acknowledged her lack of attention to us by coldly saying, ""I apologize for your wait as I was helping another guest"". Huh. Not buying it. And that wasn't even an apology and now I've gone on way too long. Sort of like that wait for our table, so I'll get to the food. 

We ordered quite a few dishes off of the tapas style menu. My favorite of the night was the Korean fried tofu. So delicious! Like an explosion in your mouth. Delicately spicy with black sesame. The bao buns were good too, stuffed with pickled slaw and caramelized eggplant. The ricotta was creamy and flavorful. The Charlie sliders were good, but I found that I was desiring more flavor. I ended up spreading some of the ricotta on the burger because the jalapeño jam just didn't show up for me. The curry spiced rice that came with the cauliflower steak was delicious but the cauliflower itself was nothing special. As far as flavoring goes, I detected very little. 

We waited a long time for service. Our order wasn't taken for about another 15 minutes as we sat at the table. But here is that patient part I am willing to impart. It was busy and I could see that and once our server got to us he was efficient and kind. The dishes came out staggered which is one of the reasons I like eating tapas. One keeps getting surprises all through the night. 

The cocktails were good. I started with the Lucy and Ricky which tasted ok. It seemed a bit watered down but was our first drink so not sure if it had been sitting on the bar for a minute before it got to us. The Bullseye, however, was delicious. The bourbon and absinthe was so flavorful and it felt warm going down.

I had been wanting to try this place for a while now. Given the treatment by the hostess and the shall we say, ""bad taste it left in my mouth"" and dishes that felt a bit tired, I probably won't return.

I didn't really realize that you can find donuts at places other than donut shops and bakeries, so once I discovered Bossie's attractive looking donuts, I knew exactly where to go whenever my next craving for donuts hit.

Some were great while some were only okay. But all of them looked lovely with their colors and toppings. The donuts are more fried than I'm used to, giving the exterior a crunchier texture. I didn't mind this, but they were overall too greasy. Oil heavily stained the box, and my fingers glistened after holding and eating the donuts. Realistically, this review is closer to a 3.5 than a 4 out of 5.

I'm not a classic glazed donut person (too boring for me), so I love the variety of flavor combinations offered. Here's my run down:
- Chocolate and almond toffee: can't go wrong with this one!
- Rose geranium and rhubarb: flavors were faint and could use more rose geranium.
- Cardamom, kumquat, and pistachio: cardamom overpowered the other flavors, and more candied kumquat slices would be great.
- Pistachio cruller: I wish the pistachio flavor was stronger, but the eggy flavor and airy texture of the cruller reminded me of the comforting Chinese fried sugar egg puffs I'd eat at home.
- Honey and black sesame cruller: I was ecstatic to see the introduction of a flavor more commonly found in Asian desserts, black sesame. This was my favorite because I loved the nuttiness and intensity of black sesame.

Mind you, this isn't a place that you can just walk into and grab a doughnut. This is a pop-up as of now but I'm hoping they find a permanent location in the near future. I know they would do very well here. They accept online pre-orders on Thursdays beginning at noon. Check out their website to order at:

Pick-up is on Saturday & Sunday and you can choose the time slot they offer. You get 4 Mochi doughnuts for only $12! I thought that was a great deal for what you get. 

Picking up my order was easy. There was a sign on the sidewalk pointing me into the driveway and into the parking lot. So curbside pick-up is the only way to get these right now. Don't forget to wear a mask! 

Each week 4 different flavors are offered. My order consisted of Guava, Black Sesame, Milk & Cereal, and Matcha Wonderland. The Guava was my favorite but then again I'm a fan of all things Guava. The black sesame had a slight smoky, nutty flavor. Milk & Cereal was sweet, creamy and totally reminded me of eating an actual bowl of cereal. The Matcha Wonderland reminded me of drinking matcha tea but the flavor was very subtle. 

I couldn't get over the texture of these! Definitely not your average doughnut. These were very light and chewy just like a Mochi. It was suggested that if we didn't eat them right away to leave the box slightly ajar so they kept their texture. But we ate them right away so all was good.

For dessert, we ordered the sesame creme brulee and tiramisu. I absolutley loved the nutty addition of black sesame to the creme brulee, but it had an unexpectedly thick consistency. The tiramisu also fell a little flat with the thick layer of cocoa powder leaving us in caughing fits.

I have to admit that this place has been around in Avon, IN for three years now and this is the first opportunity we dined there.  The saying, ""It was worth the wait"" applies in this instance.  We left full, refreshed, and with plans to come right back with friends.  You have not had Thai until you've been here.  Well decorated, very clean, cozy dining room, and well attentive staff are certainly making a presence at this restaurant.  The menu was not cluttered with a lot of variations of the same dish, offered a great variety for everyone's tastes, and coverage the bases to appeal to the most finicky diners.  

We started our meal off with he Summer Rolls topped with fresh shrimp.  They featured a nice, cool soybean wrap and were light and refreshing with the peanut sauce.  We then selected the Spicy Lemon Grass Soup, which was amazing.  Hearty chunks of tomato, onion, lemon grass, and other veggies complimented the clear, lime, cilantro, and green onion medley.  This would make a great lunch for those looking to cut back and eat healthy.  For our entrees, we sampled the featured Mango Red Curry, which was prepared on the mild scale to our liking.  However, we elected to try two other dishes since we were in the state of adventure, since this was a new experience.  

To our further amazement, the Pahd Cashew Nut with shrimp and the Pahd Thai shrimp exceeded our expectations.  Generous portions, fresh selections of veggies and shrimp (I might add they were flavorful and 25-30 count size), along with the very best quality jasmine rice with black sesame seeds for garnish, arrived to our table within a very quick amount of time.  As we dove into the dishes, you could taste why Thai is my new favorite cuisine.  Thai uses fresh herbs, vegetables, and seasonings to enhance the natural flavors of the ingredients. You won't find soy sauce to mask the flavor or heavy, thick sauces.  Crisp, clean, and light, the entrees left use full and content.  We took half of each entrée home as well.  

Sometimes people get intimidated to try new foods from different cultures, but Thai Lanna serves these dishes from a colorful menu with featured dish pictures and menu descriptions.  They also serve any dish with different degrees of heat.  You can go plain with no spice, Mild, Medium, Hot, and THAI HOT.  Try at your risk since I selected ""hot"" on one dish and it cleared my head with a pleasant and surprisingly HOT bite.  I am not complaining by any means...I loved it.  I am just trying to set the tone so you won't go over board.  Sample, sample, sample and you will enjoy the experience.

The wait staff is truly attentive to every detail.  Fine linen napkins, tidy table tops, and rich atmosphere provided for an unbelievable dining experience.  Our glasses were full, dirty dishes were quickly removed, and the table was well prepared between courses.  We were in and out within an hour and we enjoyed our long conversation with the owner, Kelly, who was on site and working her magic in the kitchen.  We discussed her inspirations for her dishes and complimented her on the experience.

My recommendation is to try a little adventure and visit Thai Lanna in Avon, IN.  The prices are very reasonable for the portions and this is going to be our new home for  while.  I am sure if you are looking for a fresh new place to try out, you will leave pleased and impressed.

It's as Korean as possible, while still appealing to an average American palate.  It's advertised as ""fusion"" so I can't knock it for being 100% authentic Korean, and it meant that my boyfriend could enjoy it since he's not super familiar with Korean flavor combinations. 
Why the 3 stars:  the business model and service just killed any chance that I could give this place more than 3 stars.    

The menu is haphazard mess of different boxes of appetizers, mains, sushi, buffet, lunch buffet add-on prices, sides prices, prices for sides with something, prices for rice, prices for... It's just nickel & dimed to death and incredibly poorly organized.  Add to this that the server we had told us that we could only get banchan (the variety of kimchis and side dishes that typically are brought to you with a meal, and included in the cost of your meal) from the buffet - but then said I could actually get banchan (which she kept calling ""sides"" and didn't understand what I meant when I said banchan for .99 cents a plate from the buffet - but then the food runner said I could get them only from the buffet, at $25 for the buffet & sushi price on the menu...  Yeah, confused yet?

We finally established that you can either get the all-you-can-eat sushi and ""sides"" buffet OR you can get your ""sides"" from the buffet for .99 cents each.  I chose the per plate price of .99 cents. The server asked me twice how many sides I was getting so that she could add them to our tab, and I told her twice that I would need to go see what the options were first since she couldn't tell me. 

The buffet was lacking sorely, especially for a Friday night.  The ""House Special"" salad is just spring lettuce mix with 2 bottles of store-bought dressing.  There were also sliced apples. The banchan dishes available were a cucumber kimchi, mixed vegetable pickle, yellow curry main dish, rice, and miso soup.   I dished a small plate of cucumber kimchi and of mixed veg pickle.  Before I could finish dishing the server came up to me to ask again how many plates I was getting.  I told her two and went back to the table. 
Adding to the frustration were the cooks who were talking about me as I was at the ""buffet"".  I know just enough Korean to know they were discussing the ""African"" in the place. It definitely didn't make me feel welcome.  If there's a way to say I felt like someone was worried I was going to shoplift a side dish because of the color of my skin, this is it.  It was all a bit absurd, and I considered leaving. 

I don't know if K-Fusion took on this pricing model because they had previously given banchan to those who ordered appetizers and there was considerable waste, but it was really disappointing.  We thought the cucumber was good (thick slices, marinated in gochujang, and I think some fermented shrimp paste) and the mixed veg pickle was bright and refreshing, with good firmness still in each veg.  The waitress confirmed that everything was made fresh in-house, including the sauces, and it showed in the quality. 

We ordered Bulgogi (1 of 4 ways to rate a Korean restaurant; the others being their banchan, bibimbap, and kimchi),  spicy pork, and the shrimp tempura app.  I tried to get the BF to order the bibimbap, but he was still scarred from the horrible one he got at Gang Nam and flat refused to try again. 

I was nervous because we didn't see traditional cabbage kimchi anywhere on the menu or buffet, but the server assured me we would get the first one free with our entrees.  

After the confusion the servers had with the food, and Korean food tradition in general, and terrible menu/meal structure I was a bit dubious of how good the food would be.  This is where K-Fusion won us over. 

The shrimp tempura were fresh shrimp with a deep golden and super crispy panko tempura crust.  The shrimp were sweet and cooked just right.  The ponzu sauce wasn't sweet, and added just the right counter note to the tempura.  It was the first bright moment in our meal. 

The Bulgogi and Spicy Pork were spot on.  My Bulgogi was made the traditional way, and I could taste that they didn't use pineapple juice to sweeten and texturizing the beef, but instead went with kiwi.  This makes a world of difference and is much appreciated.  The spicy pork wasn't too hot (it was actually pretty mild), but this allowed for all of the flavors to be tasted.  The rice was cooked well and a few black sesame were added. 

We were charged for the one kimchi they brought after we asked for it.  The server said she'd take it off, but we'd have to pay for the second.  We had to remind her that we were only given 1, after we asked for it...  She adjusted the charge. Ugh.

K-Fusion has promise.  It reminds me of a Korean street market food stand.  It needs more dish options (or specials), better educated servers, complimentary banchan, and it'd be a regular visit for us.

We were nearly as far from the dining room as you could be, so I did not see much there.

We had 3 servers who were working with our table. At the beginning of service, they were a little distracted because they were winding down after a busy lunch service (our lunch reservation was at 1PM). Fortunately, we were pretty relaxed and were not overly anxious about being served.

Because of the size of our party and our appetite, we did 3 courses, but we shared so I was able to try many dishes. For our appetizers, we had:

Homemade Andouille and Boudin Sausages: a 3.5"" link of a soft boudin sausage (white sausage with rice) and a 3.5"" link of smoked andouille were served atop slow cooked collard greens and topped with a piece of toast and beer braised onions with a bit of country mustard on the side. The sausages were great. The white sausage was mild and very well-seasoned. The andouille had a nice heat. The greens were mild and the onions were sweet. The tangy mustard was just right.

Blue Crab and Brie: fresh angel hair pasta was tossed in a brie cream sauce with fresh corn kernels, shredded sweet crab meat and slices of jalapeno. This was a sweet and spicy dish that was well prepared.

Escargots Buorguigon: 4 halves of red potatoes were each filled with escargots and resting in a pool of garlic butter and topped with bacon-breadcrumbs and sweetbreads. I don't like potatoes, and the escargots were a little small, which was a letdown. The sweetbreads were great - very tender and fresh. The herbed butter and bacon breadcrumbs were also great.

Seafood Gumbo: well-seasoned brown based soup with generous chunks of seafood, bits of okra and quite a bit of rice. This was very good - not the best that I have had, but very good.

Shaved Brussels Sprouts Salad: shredded sprouts were tossed with cubes of unripened peaches in a vinaigrette and topped with grated parmesan and half of a soft boiled egg. This (and the sausage) were the two best appetizers. The crispy veggies with the tangy vinaigrette and nutty cheese and rich egg were a nice combination. The peaches were flavorless, but it was very good.

LO1 had the BBQ shrimp for lunch. There were four or five super tender shrimp covered in barbecue sauce made with housemade Worcestershire sauce and topped with chives and served with a little buttermilk biscuit. She inhaled the biscuit so I did not get a bite, but the shrimp were great.

LO2 had a custom made grilled cheese sandwich. A brioche bun was grilled with cheddar cheese and served with housemade French fries. The sandwich was fantastic, and she ate almost all of it!

For our entrees, we had:

Crusted Gulf Drum: my choice was a flakey white fish that was crusted in a seasoned breadcrumb mixture and served atop a mélange of red bell pepper, zucchini and mirliton squash with a flavorful brown sauce. I thought it was amazing. Light fish with a crispy exterior, sweet veggies and flavor forward sauce.

BBQ Roasted Salmon: fantastic fresh salmon with crispy skin was smothered with sweet BBQ sauce and served atop squash and crispy potato pieces and topped with fried onions and some fresh parsley. The BBQ sauce here is amazing. This was definitely one of the best dishes at the table.

Pork Sandwich: a rather large Kaiser roll had a breaded pork cutlet and was topped with provolone cheese, giardiniera, and little tomato. This had almost no flavor - I would skip it.

Pastrami Salmon Rachel: a thin housemade black sesame bagel was topped with smoked salmon, gruyere, country mustard, cabbage slaw, chopped egg and Russian dressing. While it was the most un-kosher deli sandwich, it was fantastic. The bagel was toasted and slightly crispy. The salmon was nice and smokey. The rich and tangy toppings added just the right crunch. Very good.

We shared 3 desserts. The chocolate peanut butter pie was meh. It was basically an Oreo cookie crust with chocolate and peanut butter flavored fudge layers with whipped cream and peanut brittle. It was not very flavorful. The banana cream pie was pretty good - graham cracker crust was filled with custard and bananas and topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. It was very dense and rich and the second best banana cream pie that I have had. The best dessert that we had was the chocolate dauberge cake. It was a thin, long slice of the chocolate layer cake topped with malted chocolate balls, candied orange and malt whipped cream. It was a rich, chocolate cake with a light sponge and rich frosting, lovely sweet tangy accents and a little coffee flavor.

The service was excellent and the food was very good. There were some misses - the pork sandwich, the escargot and the desserts. But it was a great experience.",2017-08-11 03:28:11,Emeril's ,800 Tchoupitoulas St,New Orleans,LA,29.9447869,-90.0673771,"Seafood, Cajun/Creole, Restaurants, American (New)"

The parking lot is convenient, and it has cameras on the entrance/exit. The decor is fresh, the restaurant and bathrooms look clean, and the layout is nice and open (at least when there are fewer than 30 people there). The first floor bar is covered with TVs, but they're not huge. If your focus is a TV, sit at the bar, not a table, unless you have great vision.
The tap list has a good mix of local beer, big beer, and cheap beer ($3 yuengling drafts are hard to beat). The service was good; drinks were quick, and our waitress was always back to check on us. 
The tuna wontons were fantastic! Raw tuna, avocado, black sesame seeds, and Sriracha aioli on a crispy, fried wonton. It speaks for itself. 
The bbq chicken flatbread was really good, too. The bbq sauce was rich and bold, and the flatbread was nice and crunchy. 
We also had the soft pretzels, which were so hot, soft, and fluffy. They didn't have much of the soda-y crust that would give them a distinctive pretzel flavor, but that didn't stop me from enjoying them with the cheesy mustard sauce.

aQNAzcetnPLQyur-p2ur2A,6cAtCGNH4_mX9MnZHOO04A,_zdARZbZNr4k8AD-SJDCgg,4.0,0,0,0,"Ah, Froyo. I love frozen yoghurt and I love options. Sometimes, too much is a bad thing, but that's why I love how you can put as much as you want! I've been to my fair share of froyo places, but they tend to have more Asian flavors like taro or black sesame. Here? They have imaginative AMERICAN flavors like Orange Dreamsicle and Blueberry Pecan Pie. Same concept of unlimited toppings, though, and they're pretty similar as well, though they have other items like cereal and granola as well.

I actually struggled a bit when I came in. The staff were busy taking care of orders so I stood by the menu and alternated between studying that and staring at the extensive toppings bar. Then I got distracted by something else. I finally realised that the actual yogurt was behind me. I knew the staff saw me, but I guess they thought I knew how it worked. Would have been nice if they asked me if it was my first time or needed help. I mean, someone can't be so indecisive to stare at the menu and then toppings for 3 minutes, right?

First, I wanted a smoothie, but I already had a smoothie that morning. I was curious about the Froyo Float and was amused by the Beer Float. I saw the crepes (very reasonably priced at around $4 each), but I wanted something cool... though I was tempted by those as well. I can't say anything about the size, but if I came again, I'd probably try one with a smoothie. I ended up going for a custom froyo. 

Something new that they offer are these little dividers to prevent your yoghurt flavors from combining. I added one just for fun, even though they don't really work for me. I love all sorts of flavors and I love trying new things, so I usually have around 4 flavors or so. I added two flavors in each of the two compartments and threw some toppings on top. Their froyo tastes like most of the froyo places I've been to. The flavors were unique to them and mostly distinct. It was good - can't really complain. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely come by if I needed a froyo fix.

Hubby got his iced coffee - cold brew. He's curious about that. He thought it tasted fine... I think he still prefers his coffee hot and black. I tasted it as well since I prefer cold drinks. It tasted a little different. I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means though I used to drink it a lot (Hubby drinks more than enough for the two of us now), I thought it tasted a little different. Smoother? Different undertone? Either way, it wasn't a bad thing. It also seems like they use Intelligentsia coffee. I'm not familiar with this brand, but I heard of it a lot when I started research of coffee places to visit while visiting the Midwest.

All in all, I love their choices. After you order, they bring it to you (unless you designed your own froyo treat). The place was pretty large and clean with a good amount of customers coming in and out. It would have been nice if they were less passive with their service, though. Despite that, they were pretty nice when they did help.",2015-08-01 04:19:54,Pearings Cafe + Frozen Yogurt,6 W Washington St,Indianapolis,IN,39.7671706803,-86.1584665243,"Food, Specialty Food, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Internet Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Fruits & Veggies, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Do-It-Yourself Food"

They were an absolute hit at the party as young and old alike were clamoring to try as many flavors as possible. 
The Azukies 'n Cream was truly original. The cake was soft and fluffy and the frosting was succulent. The Miso Caramel Apple was amazing too as was the Red Velvet. But the winner by far (for me) was the Peanut Butter Crumble- perfect balance of sweet, nutty flavor and crunchiness. Just delish!

It is clear that the food they are serving cannot be had on the main line.  This does not mean that it is the right choice for someone who lives half a mile away.  There are too many other good options for the money.

We started off with the oysters, 5 for $14 (not a great value, but not an insane markup) that came with fried shallots and a vinaigrette.  They were good, but there was not nearly enough acidity and the shallots tasted exactly like French's out of the can.  The dish was decent, but not memorable.

We then moved on to the scallop noodles and the whipped foie.  The scallop noodles were tasty and an inventive take on the mollusk, but the seasoning fell flat.  Once you got over the fact that they made scallops into noodles, it was a boring dish that tasted like butter and black sesame seeds.  The foie was a huge disappointment.  I honestly did not taste any liver and even if there is some in there, it was impossible to recognize with the other many flavors on the plate, most of which tasted as though they belonged in a dessert (not just fruity, but overly sweet).

Finally our shared entree arrived, a small but very well cooked piece of short rib.  The portion was way too small for $23, when considering that there was basically nothing else on the plate and the meat cost $2.50.  It was very tender and served with a yogurt and pineapple gel.  The flavors worked very well together, but again nothing memorable.

We left hungry (we were aware from the outset that we might have under ordered), but had no interest in trying another dish.  The plates were too small, too expensive, and not tasty enough to warrant a return trip.

I would have licked the bowl if I was at home. Then an assortment of sashimi. 3 kinds of tuna, butterfish and octopus with salmon roe.

PARKING - parking is a little hard to find, so you might circle around a few times.

PLACE - interior design is black, both sleek and chic. Beautiful place to take photos of.

SERVICE - great! Server gave us enough attention without smothering us.

MEAL - this restaurant features a seasonal menu
1) Breakfast gnocchi (coddled eggs, bacon, crispy potato skins): I never imagined eating gnocchi for brunch, but now I can see it as a thing. The gnocchi was soft and delicious. The bacon and crispy potato skins were the saltiest part of the meal, which is balanced out by the eggs. Favorite dish of the meal.

2) Cornbread waffle (peanut butter, root beer syrup): I don't like root beer, but I was curious about root beer syrup. This was a good dish with homemade peanut butter (which is so much fluffier than store brand). The cornbread made the waffle less heavy in the stomach. Also a good dish, not my favorite.

3) ELA burger (shitake mushroom jam, aged cheddar,
 black sesame bun, potato chips): this burger is REALLY GOOD. The balance between patty and bun and veggies are perfect. The chips were special because they were house made and seasoned well - it was neither too salty nor too bland.

ELA does a great job of making minor substitutions to their dishes that result in me not feeling as bloated as I normally would, like the cornbread waffle (instead of flour).

I am pleased to report that I am now officially over myself. Tonight, I popped my Gaja Gaja cherry. 

The restaurant is lovely. It's serene, the service is really good, and actually let me cut to the most important part: the fish. 

Unlike the four or five other sushi places I've been to in Philly since moving here this year including more notable and celebrated places like Fat Salmon, Gaja Gaja is the only one whose sushi menu focuses on actual fish. 

(In fact I'm really unclear why so many sushi restaurants in Philadelphia feature almost anything BUT fish: tempura/crunchy rolls, mayo everything, sweetened everything, crab stick everything, cream cheese, jelly, bacon ....)

Tonight I had:

Miso soup (delectable - nice complexity to the broth, and perfectly piping hot, just the way I like it)

House salad (standard iceberg w good fresh ginger dressing)

Real California roll (lump crab meat instead of crab stick -- very nice to have the option of real, as crab stick is just crab-flavored weirdness whipped up with flour.) The rolls are studded with white and black sesame seeds -- very nice)

Unagi sushi (a standout)

Yellowtail sashimi and maguro sushi (both were very fresh with velvety texture and clean flavor)

Ikura (honking-big salmon fish roe on slightly unwieldy chunks of cucumber. Sim, the sushi chef - not sure if I'm spelling his name correctly - engaged with me at various times throughout my me, and explained to me that the roe is marinated in sake and honey to achieve a mild flavor. I was very pleased.) 

Very delicious iced green tea.

I wasn't in an alcohol mood so I did not seriously peruse their booze menu. But I couldn't help but notice the wine bottles presented over the sushi bar.  Mondavi, Jacob's Creek, Beringer, probably Kendall-Jackson ... blech ... all bottom of the barrel (ba dum bum).

Beerwise they seem weak as well (eg, Coors Light, Heineken) but they do have Sapporo, which is redeeming. They offer sakes as well. I am not knowledgeable about sake, so I can't offer insight here.

In sum: the food was delish, all presented very nicely; service was ***extremely*** friendly and warm; the atmosphere was refined and chill; and the prices were ridiculously reasonable. 

They also offer a Korean menu -- I'm not a fan of hybrid menus (ie Japanese and Chinese) but fortunately it doesn't detract from their fine sushi.

Typically I'm a pizza purist​ and stick with traditional​​ ingredients but not when I go to CPK, I go straight for the Thai Chicken Pizza ($14.49). It was AMAZING, crisp crust, delicious fresh ingredients with just a little pop of spice.

My husband and I each started with the Petite Wedge Salad ($5.49). I cannot imagine what a BIG wedge salad looks like... this was a big wedge of fresh, crisp iceberg​ lettuce with big chunks of tomato, crunchy bacon and crumbled hard-cooked​ egg with plenty of really creamy flavorful​l blue cheese dressing.

Our friends shared the ​Szechuan​ Chicken Dumplings ($8.99) it was a good size portion of dumplings​ with a slightly spicy sauce, green onions, cilantro, ​and black sesame seeds. They raved about the flavor and lightness​ of the dumplings.

Beyond my Thai pizza,​ everyone else went for a different style​​ of​ pizza. 

My husband had the Thin Crust Sicilian ($16.39) Spicy marinara, Italian sausage, spicy Capicola ham, salami, Mozzarella, shaved Parmesan, fresh basil & oregano. RAVE reviews, crispy, lots of flavors​ and a ton of toppings.

Our friends had an​ Original Hand Tossed Pepperoni ($13.99) piled with big fat slices of pepperoni.

The other friend had the Mushroom, Pepperoni, Sausage ($15.49) with cauliflower​ crust. Really, really well-made​ pizza, great flavors and he didn't miss the regular crust at all.

Our server Chance dod a great job of keeping drinks filled, offering cheese and peppers, keeping the table clear and checking in with us on a regular basis. Great server!

The ambiance is something between modern pub and French bistro, and our server was very helpful and efficient. The room is pretty cozy, so reservations are definitely recommended.

I started with a garden martini of craft gin combined with muddled basil, cucumber, and a splash of soda ($11). Though not as chilled as I'd like, it tasted like a fresh herb salad tossed in a boozy dressing. It made me think of an early summer sunset.

Nearly everything from the kitchen was served with toasted bread rounds and crackers, including a cheese and meat plate with three, thin slices each of prosciutto, salami, and capicola, paired with brie, Jarlsberg, and Manchego cheeses ($18, chef's choice on the day's selection). The first two meats were fine, but the coppa was a step above. Really nice spicy finish; I only wish there'd been a little more on the plate. The cheeses were all good and served at the proper room temp.

Next was a dish of prosciutto-wrapped asparagus spears served atop a spring mix salad, dressed with freshly grated parmesan cheese and balsamic vinegar ($7.50). Though the flavor combination worked, the hefty stalks were a bit woody and undercooked. We followed this with skewered, bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese, served with the same greens and balsamic drizzle ($7). Besting the spears, the dates were a knockout combination of savory, sweetness, and texture.

Moving on, we ordered plates of both ahi and beef tartar. The small cake of raw Hawaiian tuna was encircled by a schmear of mildly sweet and sour sauce, sprinkled with black sesame seeds, then topped with avocado relish, a salsa of pineapple and mango, and raw slivers of shallot ($16). It was pretty tasty and easy to share. The mound of raw steak was served in classic style--formed into a bit of a bowl shape with an intact egg yolk nestled in the center--surrounded by portions of slivered shallot, sweet gherkin, capers, and chopped boiled egg ($13.50). Once the ""yolk popping"" ceremony was complete, we scooped up a bit of everything onto toast or crackers and threw caution to the wind.

Although listed as blue lip mussels, we were served a pound of the green variety with an apology that their supply chain had fallen through ($14). Served in a bath of white wine butter sauce with shallot, garlic, and chili flake, they were tender and more than a bit spicy. I loved this dish and spooned the broth onto a crusts of bread.

A pair of large, seared sea scallops were garnished with sprouts, sprinkled with parmesan, and perched atop a pile of--somewhat bland and slightly undercooked--risotto, surrounded by a moat of chimichurri sauce and citrus beurre blanc ($15). Though perfectly seared, they were noticeably briny and lacking the trademark sweetness of scallop, a telltale sign of wet-pack shellfish. Perhaps another issue with their seafood vendor?

We finished up with bowls of salted caramel and pistachio gelato ($7.50 ea.), along with creme brulee ($8.50),  and bananas foster ($8.50). The gelato was perfect, the creme brulee tasted good but was a bit runny, and the hot, boozy bananas with vanilla ice cream were surprisingly potent. Pro tip: a bit of 80 proof sauce poured over brulee makes for a next level treat.",2017-04-22 05:05:41,Sierra St Kitchen & Cocktails,"50 North Sierra St, Ste 103",Reno,NV,39.5253654,-119.8135566,"Bars, Nightlife, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Salad, Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, American (New)"

Having been to both the NYC and the Philly Del Frisco's outposts, coupled with my obvious penchant for a proper steak, I was excited to say the least! Chef John Stritzinger, the Executive Chef of Del Frisco's Philly, was on hand to regale and cook for us. 

Bread Service

While we waited for the other diners to arrive, we were served some freshly baked bread, along with some olive oil.

Capostrano Verdicchio di Matelica 
Italy 2013 

Most of the COOK events are inclusive of wine and drink! This Verdicchio had wonderful citrus notes, with nice acidity and good body. Easily quaffable, the glass was never empty and this wine was enjoyed by all.

Tuna Tartare 
Citrus oil, wasabi cream, red onion, capers 

Tuna tartare was marinated for 24 hours in citrus oil, then topped off with a tempered wasabi cream. This was nicely balanced by the addition of red onion and the brininess of capers. A wonton crisp was provided to serve as the scooping vessel.  

Shanghai Fried Calamari

The #1 best seller at Del Frisco's and one of our favorite appetizers? The Shanghai Calamari, which features a 24-hour buttermilk marinade, with the cephalopod then deep-fried in seasoned flower, along with cherry peppers. Tossed with fresh mung bean sprouts and pickled jalapenos, texture, tang, and taste were all there. The sweetness of the black sesame helped to accentuate the delicious sauce. Highly recommended!  

Crabcake
Cajun lobster sauce

The crabcake was one of the better iterations I've had. Whole chunks of Indonesian lump crab with minimal filler came dressed with reduced lobster broth - a simple preparation of cream, lobster base, and butter. Each bite was luscious, sweet, and rich. Pro tip from Chef Stritzinger? When making crab cakes, make sure to pat your crab dry before molding and cooking!

Arugula and Kale Salad
Goat cheese, shallot vinaigrette, cranberry 

Another tip? Apparently most homemade salads aren't dressed properly. Make sure to toss the vinaigrette well - you can always add more vinaigrette so don't over-dress! And finishing with a bit of salt, pepper, and lemon can really make each bite. This was a fairly standard preparation, but certainly well-executed. The bright sweetness of the cranberries helped to cut through the richness of the tart goat cheese. The peppery arugula and substantial kale really stoop up to the vinaigrette and seasoning.

Philip Schell Malbec 
Argentina 2014 

But now, it was time for the steaks. A nice malbec was brought out to pair well with these thick-cut steaks. Bright, fruit forward, but with some light spice and a smoky finish.

Prime Steak Tasting
Sirloin, ribeye, filet mignon

The sirloin showcased great beefiness and perfect seasoning. The ribeye? Unabashedly fatty and luscious. And as expected, the filet was nicely tender and cut like butter. The portions? Repeatedly replenished. Without getting into the specifics, let's just say that I'm not embarrassed to say that even I couldn't handle all this beef. The steaks were accompanied by two sauces. The garlic butter was rich, with bits of garlic floating about. The green peppercorn was my favorite as it had a nice kick, which was perfect to offset the richness of the beef.

Lobster Mac & Cheese

Oh and wait. There's more! Del Frisco's is well known for their lobster mac and cheese. Chef Stritzigner jokingly cautioned that one bite contained more calories than he'd care to share. But I threw caution to the wind and went in for a second helping. Creamy, rich, and with the pure essence of lobster, this is the right argument for a shellfish and cheese marriage.

Shaved Brussels Sprouts
Bacon

On a slightly healthier note, shaved brussels sprouts were on offer. But of course, tossed in bacon fat to support the savoriness of the greens. Caramelized onions helped to round out the richness of each bite.

Dessert
Lemon Doberge cake, strawberry cheesecake, chocolate mousse cups 

A troika of sweet confections were presented to each diner. An off-menu favorite, the lemon Doberge cake was simply stellar. Easily my new favorite dessert, it was rich, moist, and with plenty of lemon zest to punch up the brightness. If you're ever at Del Frisco's - save room and ask for this to round out your meal! The strawberry cheesecake featured a crumbly cookie crust. And the chocolate mousse had some bitter niceties that helped to break up the richness of the dessert course as a whole.   

And with that, we were given complimentary app cards to Del Frisco's along with chocolate to take home, courtesy of COOK. Pro tips? Arrive early and grab seats on the far side from when you enter to get the best seating and views. Make sure to get on COOK's mailing list to know when the tickets are released monthly. The good ones sell out quickly! And be sure to ask questions and engage your fellow diners.

Also, all those poor (hmm) people at the Four Seasons Hotel will now have to venture out for dinner until the new Comcast building is built.  My friend and I heard the news about the end of dinner service and quickly made a reservation before this four bell Craig LaBan restaurant went extinct.  

Upon arrival, the hostess checked our coats and promptly sat us at our reservation time.  The dining room is spacious, classic, plushy, woody, and leathery.  It is quiet enough (perhaps because it is so spacious) that you can have a conversation with your dining companion without being disturbed by the goings-on at the next table over.  Service was impeccable, we asked for and received recommendations on everything, from wine, to food, to cheese and all were spot-on.  This is not a place for a quick bite.  Dinner moved along at a leisurely pace, which allowed you to digest each course before starting on the next.  Despite the pace, at no point did I feel that I was waiting too long for my food or drinks.  It allowed me to truly enjoy the entire experience.

To eat, both my friend and I ordered the butternut squash risotto with smoked gouda, curry oil, toasted black sesame seeds, and chanterelle mushrooms.  It was perfectly cooked, deliciously cheesy, and all the flavors complemented each other in a way you wouldn't expect (curry with smoked gouda are two things I would never think to put together myself).  

For my second course, I ordered the duck breast ""peking style.""  The skin was crispy, it was cooked to my specification, and placed on top of fluffy, buttery celeriac puree in a honey and red wine reduction.  The dish was excellent and tasty and surprisingly had a lot of umami flavor.  

For dessert, my friend and I went with the cheese plate and WOW, it is no joke at Fountain.  When you order, you are presented with a cheese trolley.  Ours had approximately 20 cheese we had to decide between (and our poor server had to describe to us). We went with the three cheese plate.  Portions were more than generous, and each of our selections was stinky, salty, or smokey goodness (as appropriate).

I also asked our server to do a wine pairing with my meal.  He selected the pinot gris to accompany the risotto, a classic merlot to go with the duck, and a port for my ""dessert"" course.  I was impressed with the selections, as each went well with my dishes and added depth to my dining experience.

Notes before you read: the required dress code is one of the best parts of this dining experience, so do everyone a favor and pack your finest if you plan to visit. Don't skirt around the rules in a polo shirt and dark jeans, mmmmkay? People come here to show off and you should too! It's respectful. 

Ok now on to the experience! Because this wasn't just a meal, although the food was tremendous. 

Ordered: 3 course meal, includes an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert (not to be missed).
I had the squash salad - one of the best salads I've ever had. Shaved squash, goat cheese, tomato, and a tangy vinaigrette finished with micro greens and black sesame seeds. My entree was shrimp and grits - slightly spicy, sautéed with peppers and tomato, and creamy dreamy grits. My dessert was the best part - DO NOT MISS the bourbon bread pudding soufflé. DONT. They finish it at the table, after it makes it's way across the dining room all fluffy and jiggly and show-offy, with a bourbon sauce that is to die for. Cut into that bad boy and amaze your taste buds. 
My partner ordered the gumbo appetizer, which we both decided was some of the best we've had in NOLA, smooth and rich and dark as hell. His entree was beef medallions, over small potatoes, perfectly cooked and slightly smoky. His dessert was a giant chunk of cheesecake - he can't ever pass it up. It was fantastic. 
With the meal we had several on-the-menu cocktails, whiskey and bourbon based, and holy heck there's a reason good things come in small packages because these packed a wallop but were mighty delicious. 

Now - on to the experience. Upon arrival you're whisked in to the dining room all gussied up just like the diners, jazz brunch includes balloons and streamers at each table! Once seated we heard the familiar sound of a jazz trio, moving about the dining room stopping at each table. The singer told us they had just started back into indoor dining and performing a few weeks before, and they were so happy to be there. The energy was fun and oh so perfectly New Orleans. When they arrived at our table and asked if we wanted a song played, we asked for ""Just a Gigolo"" which they happily obliged (don't forget to tip these people!) and we sang along. 
About to dig into my entree when a staff member roused us all up out of our seats and started a second line parade through the dining room. There is something to be said for dancing around one of the finest restaurants in the south, waving a napkin, cheering on other diners in their Sunday best.

Not even sure what happened there, but it was gone. A week later this Ra Bar was advertising for Edmonton Downtown Dining week. My husband and I despite the Corona Virus warnings decided to give it a try. 

It is nice enough inside. Really modern black with accents feeling. They were just open a week I found out. It shows. Service was not great. Our server took a long time with water, menu, drinks, etc. Which okay if the place was busy (it wasn't) and if restaurants didn't need to clamour for customers, then fine. But both things existed. We went out in this environment and basically there was us and two other couples in the restaurant, we shouldn't be waiting for service.

We decided on the Downtown Dining menu:
Half Japanese Potato Salad - hard-boiled egg, cucumber, pickled onion and fire-roasted corn
Half Wagyu Carpaccio - Brant Lake Wagyu cured with onion ash, arugula, and crispy garlic
Smoked Duck Breast - miso-glazed smoked duck breast, garlic, rosemary, and spaghetti squash
Black Sesame Ice Cream Pie
 and also The Angry Tuna Rolls 

So where service was sloppy food was not. Food came out in a timely manner and it was delicious. We loved the flavours in the tuna rolls. The potato salad was delicious and interesting. The smoked duck breast was tender and tasty although I found the spaghetti squash to be bland. I would like them to do something more about the side flavours in that. The Wagyu was decent, my husband enjoyed it. I found the meat to be a little to ""wet"". I like my carpaccio to be cured a little dryer to pick up flavours, and it should not be dripping off my chopstick. Sesame ice cream pie was just the right amount, perfect in balance of sweetness and savoury. Would order that again.
 However all in all a decent meal. 

It took forever for the bill (again no idea why) and I ordered a sake (Which was cold and they didn't specify in the menu. So when I said that I didn't know that it would be cold when they brought it out our server just shrugged her shoulders. Really, for professionalism she should of offered to take it off my bill or replace it with another drink). Anyhow they over doubled the price of my sake. It should have been 13ish bucks (and for something I didn't want in the first place) but it was charged with over 30.  Luckily my husband spotted the issue, and pointed it out. It took at least 10 minutes for the bartender to fix it. Again no idea why. And when I pointed out that in most Japanese restaurants they have hot and cold sake sections, he agreed that they were still working on the menu. No compensation, no even sorry.

This is not the way to have regular customers. If the manager is reading this and wants a discussion I would love to have one. I see a lot of potential with the kitchen that will go to shit with the service and management.
 

The current times, restaurants can't afford to make mistakes. Or the can make mistakes and then make them up to the customers by at least apologizing (for the long wait, for not getting what you expected etc.) or to take things off your bill or replace them with something that the customer would like. This place didn't do either of this things. I am thinking that unless Ra Bar shapens up their ship deck they will be going down with the tide. Which is sad, because actually most of our food was delicious.

At the end, I think I can revise it for my revisit next time. This place is big. I definitely like the bar area. It has great tv. 

I was here to try out the newest restaurant in the St. Pete area. This is one of the few restaurants has it own parking lot. It is free parking compare to many area here requiring parking fees. It is a plus. 

I got the pork belly ramen to start. This ramen come with 3 good pieces of pork belly grilled to good perfection. I would add salt or sugar to the pork belly with better taste before grilled. The soup may want to add some black sesame oil to enhance the flavor. This ramen is good, however I think just need a slight improvement to make it great. 

I got the chance to try their category five sushi roll. This is a spicy tuna top with avocado and Kabayaki sauce. In addition it top with imitation crab meat. It is a very good roll. Love the taste. The other roll is the their one of most order rolls- snow mountain rolls. This is a tempura shrimp inside and top with real snow crab meat. I think this is a must order item if you visit them. I would recommend this roll.

I will admit that my expectations were not high as it was Restaurant Week - a period that we generally avoid like the plague.  However, I was pleasantly surprised and frankly blown away by the food that was served.  

We both had the Rose Gold cocktail which was delicious and $2 of each drink went to the Garces Foundation. The $35 Restaurant Week menu was severely limited, in effect a pared version of the $35 pre-theater menu; but we each found dishes that looked interesting/appealing. 

For the first course we had the Hamachi Tartare and the Milk & Cereal.  The tartare was phenomenal, sublime, fresh and delicious, the togarashi flatbread was genius.  The milk & cereal a fun play on a composed asparagus soup with rice flakes, chicken thigh and thyme marshmallows - delicious.  

The second courses were the Veal Hangar Steak and the Pastrami Trout and again, both were surprising in good ways and delicious in all ways.  I had a great by the glass Riesling with my entrée and my partner had a fantastic by the glass Merlot ($28) that was worth every drop.  

We finished with the third and last course with Panna Cotta of black sesame, yuzu meringue, mandarin sorbet, Thai basil and cherry with a black and white sesame crisp that brought it all to a fantastic close. 
 Josh was our server and he was great as was Phoebe who checked in on us all night long and brought us a yummy sparkling wine sent by my sister-in-law to accompany our dessert.

That said, Sweet Handkraft does have relatively good doughnuts. We got a dozen and tried all the different flavors. They're doughnuts are easy to rip apart and almost designed for sharing, score!

Been wanting to try their dimsum since it's pretty much non-existent in Reno, and found out they were open for it on Thanksgiving, so I came right before they opened and got my order in (but I think they prefer pre-orders via Instagram)
Perapol is so welcoming, you feel like you've become instant friends when greeted. 
I got my Thanksgiving dimsum order in and it was ready within 5 minutes. 
I checked my order in the car before I left the parking lot and realized they mistakenly gave me steamed pork buns when I ordered the baked ones. 
I went back in to tell him the mistake and he graciously gave me the baked ones on the house (Thank you!)
Now to the food--
I picked up an order of siumai from Honey Bakery just before stopping by RBK to compare, and they were a pretty close match. RBK's Siu Mai tasted meatier and denser vs. HB's were softer, so I guess it's up to your preference but I enjoyed them both!
The black sesame tapioca pork dumplings were covered in a peanut sauce which paired very well together and even better with some hot sauce!! 
The pork dumplings were steamed pot stickers, so not something I'd usually order but husband would love them. 
They had a large deconstructed ha gow (shrimp dumpling) that had a thicker skin and more chives/green onions that I liked, but that's also a taste preference.
Overall I'm glad RBK is doing dimsum on weekends regularly, but would LOVE if it was daily since it's a bit of a journey for me to get here. Weekdays would make traffic more bearable :P
Perapolm's hospitality + friendliness will make me a regular customer now that I know their dimsum menu varies week by week. Must try ALLLLLL the dimsum!!!!!

Admittedly, my expectations weren't that high given some of my prior restaurant week experiences at pricier restaurants (see: microscopic portions). However, Volvér was quite generous.

I'll start with my cocktail. I ordered The Cooper and it was phenomenal. Sweet (but not overwhelming so) and rich enough for me to sip throughout my dinner. Well worth the $13.

As for the food, I ordered the hamachi tartare to start, a duck dish that I don't quite remember the name of (all of the photos I took...and not one of them was a photo of the menu), and the panna cotta. The hamachi tartare was a surprisingly generous portion for a small plate. The combination of ingredients were a bit strange to me, but somehow they all came together in a pretty tasty dish (the mango pearls were an especially nice touch). I wish I recalled more specific details of the duck dish, but I do remember the skin being crispy and the meat being tender.

The reason the experience was a 4 for me and not a 5 was the dessert. The black sesame panna cotta wasn't bad, but I didn't enjoy the taste of it enough to finish it. I thought my friend's ultra-rich cocoa choux was much better (which says a lot, as dense chocolate desserts are not my preference).

The service was fast, reliable, and friendly and the overall atmosphere was very classy. The general manager stopped by our table and mentioned that they'll be rotating their menus by country within the next few months (I think he said the first countries will be Italy and Vietnam).

Seriously. Probably the best Poke I've had so far because 1. They have way more seafood options 2. The build your own bowl structure is better 3. It's cheaper.

For less than $12 you can get a build your own bowl with choices of toppings, including Soba Noodles & Forbidden rice (delicious wild black rice that I HIGHLY recommend) for 50 cents more, THREE choices of seafood including surimi salad, squid salad, albacore, tuna and salmon and even octopus! Then all the veggie toppings you want followed by two umami toppings followed by whatever sauce you want and the ending of crispy garlic or crispy onions and sesame seeds or furikake! I had a crazy ton of fun making my bowl of forbidden rice and spring mix, squid salad, spicy tuna, and surimi salad, with like all the veggie, seaweed salad & masago, ponzu, eel sauce and spicy mayo, crispy garlic and onions, and furikake and black sesame seeds. 

Staff was crazy friendly and helpful as I made my way through the process and even let me try the rice and a sauce or two while I made up my mind! Plus, check this page because they were even offering a 10% off if you mentioned Yelp!

Walked by with a friend on our way to dinner and we decided to pop in - it's a fun looking space and the door said 'puddin' was inside there.  After trying two of the puddings, black sesame and salted caramel we decided to buy a salted caramel and a...carrot cake maybe? (Not slamming the flavor, just don't remember since it was for delivering to an at home friend).  We were also talked into trying a couple macarons - we chose earl grey chocolate and taro.

The good: it's a cute space, it's creative, the help was nice, you can taste some of the puddings, it's not like anything else in Chinatown.

The not good:  If you're a pudding bakery, in addition to creative choices (pumpkin spice banana) it might be good to sell some classics and do them really well.  Chocolate?  Vanilla? The salted caramel was nice, but not make-that-trip-again nice.  The black sesame that we tried had an uncomfortable firm mousse-like texture and tasted like weak peanut butter, but not sesame.  Again, if you only sell four puddings, and it's part of your identity, you need to nail it.  The macarons were an example of this as well.  As some other reviewers have said, they were kind of soggy and kind of bland.  The earl grey chocolate did taste like those flavors but the cookie was really too chewy.  The taro had a better crunch to chew ratio but tasted like sugar flavor only.

Also, for two puddings and two macarons we were in for $14.  Some of the best restaurants in the city serve desserts at around $8-12 per person and they are amazing.    Nothing that we experienced of Audabon was flat out terrible, but it kind of felt like the desserts were something that I might be happy to eat homemade, at a friends house, but not for spending my treat money.

It's pretty good if you like shredded lettuce, arugula, avocado, sprouts, bacon, and chicken breast. It's not a melt in your mouth, gooey cheese kind of sandwich shop. 

I prefer to order a salad because you get far more veggies and meat than the sandwiches, which are a lot of bread. I can never finish the whole salad so it's two meals in one. The Asian Greens with Chicken is my favorite with Napa cabbage, green cabbage, bok choy, chicken breast, shredded carrots, green onions, cilantro, black sesame seeds, and crispy won tons in a sweet & spicy sesame dressing. Buffalo Blue is also tasty but a little salty because of the wing sauce covering the chicken.

The brownies are pretty good - large, thick, and chewy with lots of walnuts on top. They can be a little hit or miss. The Goleta location makes them on a daily basis in the am.

The employees are welcoming and love to take orders over the phone. If you order over the phone your receipt will say,

The portions they give you are huge and the price tag is small, which makes for a great place to eat when you're on a budget.. and if you're like me and can't eat all the food they serve you, you take home the leftovers and have another meal for the next day.  the veggie rolls are my favorite, especially when craving an egg roll.  They also have a decent little asian market, which is great for when you need some hard to find asian ingredients.  They finally started carrying matcha powder (which is green tea powder) that is a great little ingredient when you want to make an interesting treat (i use it to make green tea cheesecake).  They also have black sesame seeds for a great price (just think of smokey flavored sesame seeds, so good).  I also like to get a pack of the rice candy when checking out..  a nice treat to carry around in my purse.  The staff here is really friendly, so thats another reason to keep going back.  Also, I don't think its on their menu but you can order Thai Iced Tea when checking out..  one of my favorite things to drink (although it can sometimes be a little too sweet).  I don't have a negative thing to say about this place.  I think the owner of International Market also owns PM across the street... so if you're paying attention, you'll notice that employees are always running back and forth across the street to take care of both spots.

This Chinese dessert house made its way to Edmonton after starting off in Calgary's chinatown. I have heard the prices are comparable to the original location, but it's quite expensive considering the price for 1 bowl is enough to buy ingredients for a whole pot! Of course, we wouldn't be here if everyone could make their own.

There is a ton of items listed, but not available, on their menu. My guess is they either had the food chef leave after opening or they listed it planning for future growth. That or they simply copied Calgary's version of the menu and crossed off everything they weren't offering. Either way, please stop being stingy and reprint your menus. It's been nearly half a year and your second location, so I think you can spare some change and not frustrate the hell out of your customers. It's a problem when half (LITERALLY half!) the menu is crossed off.

Anyways, we are here to talk about the food. It's not worth the price they charge but, I have got to say, the desserts are delicious and made authentically from raw ingredients. The almond drinks/desserts aren't smooth, but it proves they use real almonds versus artificial flavouring. Their tofu fa (or bean curd as they call it) was typical, but they give you the option of adding red bean or black sesame paste to it. I ordered red bean, but their black sesame paste was so amazingly delicious that I regret not being a little more adventurous. Again, their sesame paste was not smooth because it was made from grinding up real sesame seeds! If you order any of their steam egg items, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes as they make it from scratch and steam to ensure freshness. They also have rose tea, bubble tea, and taiwanese drinks available. These are drinks are borderline averagely priced to expensive. One thing to note about the drinks: If you take out, the containers are free. But if you stayed and ordered it with take out containers, they will charge you. No option of staying partly and leaving with a drink? Haha...I'm a little confused over that myself.

Their service was alright. Nothing to rave about or complain about. They did their job, but nothing exceptional.

This place would deeply hurt my wallet if I made this a regular experience, but for group hangouts, this isn't too bad. Oh, as a side note, this place can only accommodate for about 20 people at a time. With how long the food takes to get to you and limited seating, it may take a while for you to get a table/food.

Arigato is the goto sushi restaurant for my good friends that live in Santa Barbara. I have eaten here before, but it had been awhile, I was excited. We were in sort of a rush so we didn't enjoy everything Arigato had to offer, but we did have was great.

We sat at the sushi bar in front of Brian. Our meal started off with Halibut Carpaccio and Yuzu Pepper Tai sashimi. Both were delicious, the tai sashimi was really fresh, there was a little too much sauce on the carpaccio and it over powered the fish.

Next up we had Ankimo, delicious! The chefs made a few special items for us, didn't know the names or all the ingredients, but they were incredible. The highlight was a thinly sliced seared scallop topped with a crab mixture and tobiko. It was also served with cilantro oil and black sesame sauce, it was awesome.

I'm sure if you're here for the bar you can just walk in, but we were hungry and waited for someone to seat us. I really liked the whole vibe they have here. Everywhere you look there's something different. It wasn't just the posters or the random things hanging from walls and ceilings-- they have different painting styles on the walls and the furnishings were unique. Very eclectic, and therefore, fabulous! I spotted quite a few pinocchios, so they keep within the expected theme. 

Now for the food: I got the Italian Deli sandwich. Looking at the menu I told my mom the only thing missing from what I'd expect would be pepperoncinis. The waitress was sweet and easy going. Got our drinks: mom had asked for iced tea. She got it back and was surprised. They put a little bit of a fruit flavor in it. Couldn't decide if it was blueberry or blackberry. Still, really good! I got my sandwich and was immediately happy. Picking it up, a pepperoncini fell out! Day. Made. Also the bread was coated in black sesame seeds, pine nuts, and sunflower seeds. Delicious! Also it was a huge sandwich. Ate the first half and wondered if I should eat the second half. Probably shouldn't have, but no regrets, no matter how many pants sizes I went up in there! Also, they batter their french fries. Need I say more? Actually yes, it'll bother me if I don't. They were crispy, salted the perfect amount, and the insides were soft! 

Mom got the veggie wrap. We both have a weakness for blue cheese, and if you are of the same personage, please get that also. So much blue cheese. So much happiness. Yes. I stole a bite if her wrap. I will not be shamed.

I have been baking from scratch since I was in elementary school, from cookies to cream puffs to meringues and sponge cakes, and recently finished my baking quest for ""perfect macarons,"" complete with feet! I've probably read almost all of the authoritative articles on macarons that the internet has to offer. That being said...

I know most people love this place. But, I am not a fan. I've tried these twice on separate occasions (other people kindly shared with me) and not been very impressed. When a place is very hyped up, I have very high expectations in mind.

The macaron shells were rather brittle and fragile, and at least for the ones I tasted (Boston Cream Pie and also a Salted Caramel, I believe), they crumbled pretty instantly upon taking a small bite. I was looking forward to a shell with more bite- slightly chewy along with semi-crackly/crumbly. The buttercreams that they were filled in were not memorable to me, and I wonder if it was the same buttercream with just different flavored shells? Was it buttercream? Whipped cream? Vanilla? I remember double checking with my friend, wait, what flavor are these again? The names are creative, but I didn't find the tastes as assertive as I would have expected. (My theory is that the word 'salted caramel' is a buzz word, and sounds so cool that anything called salted caramel will be tasty!)  

Another gripe I have is with the pudding. To me, I like a pudding to taste slightly custardy and very creamy and smooth. The black sesame pudding I tried had quite a few whole sesame seeds in it, and if I had been to make it, I would have increased the ratio of ground sesame to sesame seeds to accentuate the black sesame nutty taste. Texturally, I would not describe it as a pudding, but more of a milky jello, because it was definitely on the stiffer side.

But I go there for the food...

Sure, I have dressed up to meet up with some good looking friends, but I have also been there in my jeans and sweater. I have also seen a family with their two small children. Good good attracts all kinds of people. 

The key to a good sushi restaurant is freshness and Arigato presents freshness in high quality. Their fish melts in your mouth without being overwhelmed by the rice. Yes, it's a small portion to some folks that are used to the ""American"" portion but if you've been to Japan, you know their size is about right. Another highlight is the innovative sauces - they are so tasty that dipping your fish to the soy sauce would just ruin the taste. 

So...here are some of my favorites:
Tai yuzu sushi - a good start to open up your appetite
Blue fin ginger tuna - another good one to start with
Yellowtail tartar - very tasty. I can eat 2 of these. If you're sharing, ask for spoons.
Seared scallops in black sesame sauce - decadent
Portabello mushroom sushi - a good way to get some veggies in your system
Kobe beef sushi - it's like a sushi hamburger. Hearty.
Snake roll - sweet & filling to end your meal

Couple of helpful hints:
- sit at the bar and get to know the chefs...ask them to make you something from their creation. (but prepare the pay the price)
- If you have a party of odd numbers, you can ask them get you odd number of nigiris (i.e. 3, 7, 9 etc.)",2008-12-26 21:15:13,Arigato Sushi,1225 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,34.4238502,-119.7054774,"Restaurants, Sushi Bars, Japanese, Asian Fusion"

Spicy Tuna Roll- Delicious, covered with toasted black sesame seeds, had more tuna than in a standard sushi bar. However, looking at the price I soon realized why it had more tuna; it cost a whopping 11.99 HOO Good lord! A spicy tuna roll will run you 6$ MAX at your local sushi joint. At my local sushi joint it's 4.50 and even with the extra tuna I'm sure it wouldn't be almost triple the price!

Pork Dumplings- Did not try personally myself but my brother loved them, he inhaled these dumplings like it was the last food on earth LOL. #DysonBrother

Korean BBQ Chicken Stir-Fry- Ended up splitting this because we ran out of room. #SoChubby This came with your typical stir fried vegetables: Red peppers, onion, green beans, sweet chili sauce, and the savory kimchi slaw. This was a solid dish however it's not anything I would ever order again, it wasn't memorable. Portion size wasn't all there. I don't consider myself cheap but for 14.50 this should have been bigger. Also the amount of rice they give you is shocking! I've never seen such a small scoop given out before in good conscious. Rice is such a cheap side so I didn't understand WHY. #ShameOnYall

The service was great, and the waitress was SUPER knowledgeable about the in's and outs of the menu which was impressive because I've been to a TON of places that have staff with no idea about what's on the menu.

One of the longest-running sushi bars in Reno recently closed, and I have to say it had seen better days. In its place is now a restaurant with food I would return for on a regular basis, Paradise Sushi.

Perhaps because they're new, the service was speedy and attentive. The chefs were quick with orders, and our server was fast on water refills; she even noticed--without being asked--that we needed more napkins. My order of hot sake turned out to be gratis, but it's possible this is because they're waiting on a license to sell the stuff. I certainly didn't mind free hooch.

We started with a plate of Paradise slaw, a varietal mix of shredded cabbage sprinkled with black sesame seeds, tossed in a lightly savory dressing. It reminded me of Vietnamese cabbage salad, but without the pungency of fish sauce. A serving of yakiton--cousin to crab rangoon--featured a single deep-fried, cream cheese and crab-stuffed wonton tube, cut on the bias and served with a sweet/spicy sauce. 

Our order of potstickers were unique (6 pieces). The meat filling was average, but the wrappers were completely fried to a deep golden brown, resembling little chimichangas more than gyoza. The miso soup was piping hot and had a lot more miso paste than most; very tasty. Best of all the starters, an order of baked mussels--also available grilled--were topped with Japanese mayo and chili sauce, served at just the right temp and in record time (6 pieces). Seriously, it felt like they arrived just moments after being ordered. Lunch AYCE includes one order of mussels, but they're unlimited for dinner diners. Mussel lovers rejoice.

The rice-to-fish ratio in both nigiri and rolls was good, and all the fish I tasted were great with a couple exceptions. The octopus was a bit tough and chewy, and the freshwater eel had an odd aftertaste I couldn't quite place. My wife said it tasted fishy, but for me it was just off enough I wouldn't order it again. Could be the sauce I didn't care for. I enjoyed all of the compound nigiri, with the ""Spicy Upside Down Shrimp Fire"" being of particular note. The flattened shrimp was topped with tuna, crab, avocado, and fire sauce. 

A Lulu roll with spicy crab, shrimp, salmon, ponzu sauce, lemon and cilantro was nice. The salmon tasted very fresh and the lemon really tied it all together. The Mt. Rose roll of salmon, spicy crab, lemon, cilantro, and tobiko was also enjoyable, though my wife noted the cilantro seemed dry rather than fresh. Cilantro loses a lot of aroma and flavor once it's dried, so using fresh herbs would be preferable.

The Wayne's hand roll was a high point of our meal. Perfect just-cooked scallop with tender, crunchy crystal shrimp and a decent mayo-based sauce. I can't recall when I've had one better. I followed this by requesting a more elaborate long roll--The Show--be converted to temaki with crystal shrimp, scallop, seared tuna, spicy crab, avocado and jalapeño. Complete mouthgasm in a crisp seaweed cone.

Similarly, a signature Paradise maki roll was rendered temaki on request, sans cream cheese as neither of us care for this ingredient in sushi. My wife loved it but wondered about the lack of jalapeño, until she found it in the bottom of the roll. It certainly added a bit of bang at the finish.

Typically a meal of AYCE sushi ends with a scoop of ice cream or mochi, but my wife wanted something more. Her tempura banana ice cream featured big slices of banana deep-fried in tempura batter, served with a whole strawberry, chocolate ice cream, strawberry cinnamon sauce, and whipped cream. A great finish for a very enjoyable dining experience.",2016-06-30 23:36:49,Paradise Sushi,"294 E Moana Ln, Ste 1",Reno,NV,39.4915873,-119.7926895,"Restaurants, Sushi Bars"

It was our first time here and there were a lot of dessert options to pick from. They have waffle combos which have their dipped cone on top of a waffle garnished with variety of toppings. They also have their original dipped cones that you can pick from: Matcha, strawberry, black sesame, chocolate etc. As well as some drinks. They do serve brunch until 4pm, and after that it seems it's strictly the dessert menu.
We opted to try the Catcha Matcha waffle combo, and two Frappes - Praline and Matcha. You can substitute the milk in the frappes for soy milk or coconut milk for an extra charge. 
We were surprised when the waffle combo came out as they also gave us two dipped cones! I'm not sure if that was just a promo during their soft opening but it was a nice surprise :)
Service was excellent and the food was great. Lactose Intolerant people be warned! There'll be a lot of dairy and the waffle combo is already quite filling for two people. 

The cafe itself is really pretty - Instagram worthy cafe for sure!
Would definitely recommend trying the desserts here if you have quite a sweet tooth. Can't wait to try out their brunch menu next time.

Right when you walk in, your cool points skyrocket.  The space is beautiful with a polished rustic interior.  The exposed kitchen is buzzing.  The music is interesting and upbeat, played at just the right volume.  And the people working there have style.

This isn't just a ramen spot, there's a bunch pan-Asian dishes with various influences like Korean, Japanese, Thai... Kicked off with a cocktail special made with gin, mint, yuzu syrup and machta green tea ($10).  Quite fantastic.

Then there's the food...the Korean fried chicken sliders ($10 for 2) are essential.  Everything about these was perfection.  The hot crispy chicken...the Korean spicy sauce that hits you with a punch, and then the sweet Hawaiian bun.  And the pickle. All in a nice little non-messy package. My god this was good.   

If you like beets, definitely get the beets w/ black sesame bread, burnt lemon, and popcorn ($7).  The plating was an absolute work of art, and the flavors & textures were on point.  Very cool and creative dish.

We went with the veggie ramen ($11) and were not disappointed.  The broth was rich, veggies were delicious, and the soft-boiled egg was just right.  The noodles were al-dente and cooked perfectly.  If I could make one suggestion, it would be to add some mushrooms to it, just because.  Along with the ramen we got a side of cucumber & tofu with lime, ginger, and chili ($6).  I highly recommend this!  The tofu was some of the best I've had, and the brightness of the dish was the perfect contrast to the savory veggie ramen.

I normally don't get dessert when eating out, but the thought of lemongrass-basil ice cream with ginger wafers ($5) was too good to pass up.   Yes, this is as amazing as it sounds, maybe even better.  It was beautifully plated, the ice cream was super creamy, and the taste almost brought tears to my eyes it was so good.

Their on-tap beer selection is truly impressive, with flavor profiles across the board and enough to keep even a die-hard regular tasting something new each time. The servers know their beers really well and are so helpful in guiding you through the menu; they always take the time to learn your taste preferences and make their own recommendations. If you're on the fence, they're always quick to offer you the opportunity to taste test anything before officially making your selection. The service has also always been pretty fast.

YES, THEY SERVE HARD LIQUOR!: So while there's no question The Tap was made for beer people... how 'bout those non-beer people? I'd always assumed that cocktails and hard liquor were pretty much off the table here. I've never seen anyone even ask for one. So I'm not sure if it's a recent thing or not, but I can now confirm that yes, The Tap most definitely serves liquor! (The fact that most people do not goes to speak for the quality of their brews.)

NEED MORE GLUTEN-FREE BEERS/CIDERS!: Therein lies probably my only minor complaint: their pretty weak selection of gluten-free beers. They do have a few basic ciders and I think 1 or 2 pre-bottled (Omission) GF beers. Which is nice but for a brewery with such an impressive and expansive selection of beers on tap, I would've expected a littttle more. So my experience when I come to The Tap never really has anything to do with the beers themselves, ironically, and more to do with the experience alone. Because my beer options are pretty much the same here as they are anywhere else.

AWESOME ATMOSPHERE: The atmosphere is definitely enough to rile anyone up, beers or not. It's fun, loud and energetic. There's always a crowd, but never to the point where I've had to actually wait for a table. It's also a really fun spot to watch big sports games.

OUTDOOR SEATING AND DOG FRIENDLY!: There is outdoor seating in the summer, always a bonus! There are both tables and comfy couch areas out there, and it's dog-friendly. They also have this beautiful outdoor wall covered top to bottom with flower planters, creating a giant flower wall. Makes you happy just to look at! Psst, Insta babes, it's a perfect backdrop for a cute outdoor lunch pic. ;)

YES, THEY SERVE DINNER, TOO!: I already went over my liquor revelaton, but did you know The Tap also offers a full menu of legit dinner options? I didn't!! Until last week, I thought they only had bar snacks and tap fries (which are fantastic, don't get me wrong.) But instead I discovered an entire menu of legit dinner options. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad. (I know I know, who goes to a brewery and orders a salad, but isn't the option nice?!) The salad consisted of seared black sesame tuna glazed in teriyaki sauce, on a romaine salad of onions, tomatoes, cheese, crunchy rice noodles, and a cucumber wasabi dressing on the side - which was so good and not spicy at all (trust me, I'd be the first to tell you). And the tuna, excellent.

The service was again quite fast, but I will say that the server was a little pushy in getting us to either drink more or leave... which I totally get, but we were eating dinner... and not for an overly long time?

My parents are here almost once a week so I live vicariously through them in between visits.  I remember when I was in high school it was a greasy spoon diner known as Charcoal, Steak and Things.  Now it is the gem of Yardley borough serving classy food in creative ways.  

My review will be based upon the Kitchen Tasting I enjoyed this past December 2011, but I think it will give any reader some insight on the abilities and creativity of the chefs here.  I have posted pictures to accompany this review.  

First Course: Oyster: cherry, leek.  Before this tasting I had never had an oyster before.  I know, I know, it took me this long, but what a way to experience my first one!  We were presented with an oyster bathing in it's own juices, covered in thinly sliced leek and a cherry foam on top.  Unfortunately my experience was dominated by the flavor of the leek, but there was a subtle presence of the cherry foam and the oyster just melted away.  Impressive presentation.

Second Course: Scallop: lentil, grapefruit, frisee.  The scallop was cooked perfectly and paired well with the lentil.  I've never had lentil outside of soup so it was nice to experience it's true taste on it's own.  Paired with the scallop and frisee, there were many layers of textures ranging from soft and mushy to crisp crunch.  I should have asked the chef at the time, but I was left wondering what the purpose of the grapefruit was.  Possibly to cleanse the pallet after eating the scallop?

Third Course: Woodcock: polenta, cherry, sprout leaves.  Yes, I looked up a picture of a Woodcock right after I ate this course!  It looked like a cross between a woodpecker and a pigeon.  Found year round in the southeast, breeding in the northeast, this particular bird was from New York.  It's flavor was gamey, the breast not as gamey as the thigh.  Along with the creamy polenta and the bittersweet dried cherry, this was a unique course.  I preferred the flavor of the breast to the thigh greatly.  

Fourth Course: Trio of Duck.  I'm sorry to those that disapprove, but duck is GOOD!  We were presented with a thick cut of duck breast with a tasty layer of fat on top, a full duck heart and deep fried duck tongue.  I was surprised that the heart was pretty tender and almost tasted like a cut of filet mignon.  The tongue were like crispy little fried clams.  It was exotic without tasting as such.  I was really impressed with how it was presented as well.  

Fifth Course: Hanger Steak: turnip, red wine, broccoli rabe.  Hanger Steak, a.k.a. Butcher's Steak presents itself almost like a flank steak in it's look and texture but offers great flavor.  We were given a generous portion of steak atop turnip puree and red wine reduction.  Topped with broccoli rabe and pepper flakes, this was the course more familiar to my taste buds and eyes.  After the adventure of the first four courses, this was a treat to finish the savory dishes.

Sixth Course: Pliable Chocolate: black sesame, meringue.  First off, look at the picture I posted and how they presented this dish.  It was awesome!  I was never a big fan of sesame but when paired with chocolate, it really redefined the flavor for me.  There was this sesame 'dust' that just disappeared in your mouth, creamy toasted meringue, black sesame ice cream and chocolate ganache.  

If you can attend a tasting here, I highly recommend it as it really exposes you to things you may never order on your own.  You don't know what your going to eat until you arrive so there is a lot of excitement involved.  The chef presents each dish with a little explanation and will answer any questions you have.

I read an article online that a senior at UMSL recently opened this store with a vision for desserts from Asia. I think he pretty much hit the spot. When I first walked in, I was very impressed with the overall ambiance of the store, the Pintrest-like seating and lighting fixtures, all the white space, cool decorations, open glass ice cream stations to watch your creation being made in front of you, etc. The only thing I didn't like was the blasting of the music. It was a little absurdly loud, but that may change in the future. 

I looked at the array of ice cream flavors, and instantly my eyes lit up at matcha, taro, black sesame, etc. Flavors I love, but don't see done well in St. Louis very much. I ended up choosing the taro flavor with strawberries, pocky, and mochi. It was around $7 plus tax. A little pricey, but my wallet can handle this every once in awhile.

I was so happy when I got my creation. The taro was so real, with actual chunks of taro. It made me want to cry tears of happiness for my taste buds. Thank you Snow Factory for not giving me fake taro powdered flavoring. My ice cream rolls were pretty dense and filling, and I had a pretty good amount of toppings. Get the taro if you are a taro lover like me!! It's fantastic.

I first went to Audabon to check out its selection of macarons and try its salted caramel pudding, but I made a very wise decision that day to also order a mini brick toast. The ""mini"" brick toast was anything but small: it was enough to feed me and my friend. That day it came with matcha ice cream, pastry cream, and pocky sticks with some blackberries on top. My friend and I loved it so much we had to go to Audabon again when we found out from Audabon's Facebook page that the brick toast flavor had changed to nutella pastry cream, salted caramel ice cream, and strawberries. I loved everything on this second toast and consequently fell head over heels for Audabon.

While so far I haven't had a macaron flavor that I dislike from Audabon, I must say the size of Audabon's macarons is smaller than Sugar Philly Truck. The salted caramel pudding was good, but it was so rich and sweet it became too much for me after eating only half of it. I have yet to try a black sesame panna cotta and matcha oreo mousse, so those two are my next conquests.

I like how cute the interior is and the free wifi, but there is one drawback to Audabon: it doesn't have a restroom for customers.

Like mentioned in many of my reviews, I am very weary of restaurants in college towns, they tend to care less about quality and services. At Sang Kee however, the service was beyond excellent. I felt very welcomed since my first step into the door. I also noticed that the service kept up entire time, not only at my table but for everyone around us. We ordered half a Peking duck, shrimp wonton soup, steamed bass with ginger and scallion, mapo tofu and crunchy tofu in xo sauce.

The food came out pretty quickly. The wonton soup was great, it was light but had flavors, the wonton themselves were packed with shrimps and pork. The Peking duck came next. It was really amazing, the seasoning really penetrated through the meat. I did wanted the skin to be a tad crispier. The crunchy tofu was my favorite. It was stir fried with minced pork, adding a rich, salty taste to the tofu. The steamed ginger fish was also great, light and fresh. They had a special going on so it was 14 dollars instead of the usual 24! The only dish I had a small complaint with was the mapo tofu. While the tofu was really fresh and I love the chunks of minced pork in there, the sauce lacked salt, it was very light. 

I could've given this a four star with the food and service combined but the owner, Micheal came out to check on us. There is such care and attention he pays to his customers that really touched me. In this crazy business world, money seems to be the only thing that matters. It's rare to meet an individual who goes beyond that. He checked on us and gave us complementary deserts. The sweet rice soup with sesame was amazing. Micheal was nice enough to give us a small history behind the dish, which only made it better. The sweet soup had a really refreshing ginger after taste that clears up your throat. The rice balls were soft with this very decadent black sesame sweet filling. It's a very simple desert that was extremely satisfying. 

This, is how a business should be! Thanks to excellent customer service and attention to details, this place earn a 5 stars from me. I hope the business keeps up this level of excellence.

They are so sweet and kind to their customers and I just love that family-owned vibe that you don't get at these mainstream bubble tea places like Kung Fu or Tea Do. 

I love their traditional bakery goods (most under a $1!!!). I would recommend trying their: pineapple buns, hot dog buns, ham and egg buns, and roast pork buns--everything is super cheap so don't worry about breaking the bank for these treats.  

If you are in the mood for bubble tea or smoothies then you can never go wrong with their fruit smoothies, but I personally love their natural black sesame tea for $2.00 (can get it cold or warm), which is hard to find anywhere else so I always get it when I come back to Philly Chinatown.

The facebook and philly asian community was buzzing about Audabon Bakeshop over the weekend. i was like ""Audabon NJ???"" Yeah...I didn't know who she was..

Made my way over on Sunday late afternoon (5pm'ish) Sold out. It's alright...i'll come back when they restock Wed. I actually came for the pull up contest but just had a big lunch, so I didn't attempt it. And 25 was a bit out of my range...lower it to 20 maybe? 

Came back Wed. night around 7pm, luckily there were some left. Ordered two of each (12 total) I was a little surprised there was no discount on anything over 5 macarons, but at $1.50...i think it's already cheap for something that can be rated ""BEST IN PHILLY"". After all, they have rent and utilities to pay for now at their physical bakery. I also got the new black sesame pudding thing too. At $5, i thought it was pricey. lol.

I think the location also messes with my perception of the products prices. Since it is located in Chinatown, I want to automatically assume its going to be ""cheap"" and filling. It isn't...it isn't expensive either. These are luxury items and the price reflects the quality and skill. At $1.50 for one (and no discount for large numbers purchased), I think they are reasonable. Are they an everyday treat like your morning coffee? I dont' think so...A quick stop after dim sum on Sundays? Sure.. perfect treat. The place is pretty spacious with some seating on the right. Not sure if they sell coffee or not, which i think Chinatown needs a coffee house since they are being overrun by tea-houses...

I can only rate the taste of the salted caramel macaron and the black sesame pudding. I'm not a big fan of macaron or sweet treats to begin with, but one bite of the salted caramel macaron was pretty good. There were layers of flavor that hit your taste buds..There was just enough sweet, just enough salt, just enough ""MmMm"". It was light, chewy, and  an enjoyable bite overall. The black sesame pudding was very decadent. I was full from dinner, but had 2 spoon fulls of the pudding and the flavor was pretty unique. Its not sweet, i'd even say bland (not in a bad way), but the nutty flavor and almost gritty texture from the sesame specs was nice. I don't see this being a big hit to non-Asians as the flavor is foreign to most people..I liked it. Reminded me of Mitsuwa's black sesame ice cream. (which is the reason i bought the pudding). 

I will update my review when i try the other flavors.

**UPDATE**

Tried the lemon and coffee flavors last night. They were pretty good too. The flavors aren't overwhelming and the texture and airiness of the macaron was great. Oh, the black sesame wasn't a pudding, i forgot it was a custard lol. After eating it some more, i do really like it. I still believe it won't be a big hit with non-asians bc of the flavor profile/texture. I think what sets these macarons apart from others are the consistency in the size/shape/flavor. The cream filling is really good, although it was on the border of ""too sweet"" for me.. but that's because i'm not a sweets person.

( btw the goat cheese and popcorn ( i think) blew me out of the water!  probably b/c i didn't expect i would like it.. but i ended up LOVE LOVE LOVING IT!!!)

so after my first experience with your lovely treats, i had to go for more! conveniently, i work in center city so i could go explore and stop by your shop basically on any given day~  i followed your cute little cartoon map at the time and took my first trip to the suburban station looking for your spot~ ... couldn't find it.  went again the day after.. still couldn't find it.. i gave it another try-- going deeper into the station and looking at EVERY direction... still saw no sign of your shop.. i was sad.. it was almost like being told of a rabbit hole that i couldn't go down into the magical wonderland.. 

but just earlier this week, a friend told me about this new macaron shop that opened up in chinatown and as soon as my friend mentioned your name.  i was like THAT""S THE ONE!!! and i knew i had to pay you guys a visit a-sap! i grabbed every flavor you guys offered! kinda sad there weren't more.. but i'll be patient! nbd :)  also tried the black sesame pudding~ freakin' fabulous!! love the flavor with your own twist and recipe!!  i don't even have a sweet tooth and im contemplating about trying another one today :]

definitely looking forward to what else you guys have to offer!  so far, your macarons are THE BEST i've ever come across!!  i know i haven't tried too many kinds to give a fair judgement, but i am ecstatic that your new shop is easy to find in chinatown!! don't worry, i am spreading the word and i will be back very soon!

I stopped in for the first time and picked up a Smoked Ham & Gruyère Croissant, a Kouign-Amann (pronounced ""queen"" ah-mahn), and a spring seasonal delicacy: the Margo. Everything was absolutely incredible! It's clear that time, energy, and (most of all) skill goes into the creation of each and every one of these materpieces.

The ham and gruyère croissant was tender ham and melty gruyère cheese with tangy dijon encased in a buttery, flaky, freshly baked croissant (even a hint warm still from the oven!) The top of the croissant had a sprinkle of white and black sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and sunflower seeds. At $4.50, it tasted FAR better than any breakfast sandwich you could get anywhere else. The Kouign-Amann is a denser croissant dough covered in a sweet, crunchy, caramelized glaze that creates a perfect balance with the soft dough interior. Now for their true show of skill: the Margo pastry. The Margo is crafted with strawberry chantilly and raspberry-lemon verbena confit, garnished with fresh raspberries that are dusted with powdered sugar, and sandwiched between two fresh french macaron cookies.

It's definitely my favorite place to eat in IV if not all of Santa Barbara. I told myself I would try all the salads on their menu by the time I graduate because I'm convinced they're all incredible, but I always end up ordering one of my two favorites: Romaine & Gorgonzola and Asian Greens W/ Chicken. The salad portions are HUGE, the combinations unique, the ingredients fresh, and the prices beyond fair!

The Romaine & Gorgonzola was my first love. I ordered it simply because it was one of the few items on the 4/20 menu ($4.20 for select sammies and salads from 4:20-5pm every Thursday). It blew my taste buds away. The Romaine lettuce is chopped into wide strips that are crunchier than julienned greens. The thinly sliced turkey adds a smokiness, the crumbled gorgonzola adds a sharpness, and the walnuts and avocado add a butteriness. The tabasco vinaigrette is tangy and ever so slightly spicy, and ties everything together beautifully.

After studying abroad for a year, I revisited South Coast and was bummed to find that the 4/20 menu had changed. The Romaine & Gorgonzola no longer appeared on it, but I'd try the $4.20 Asian Greens W/ Chicken. It was another winner. The napa cabbage, green cabbage, and bok choy add a substantial bite to the salad. I ask for no shredded carrots, cilantro, or wonton strips, but I keep the chicken breast, green onions, black sesame seeds, and sweet & spicy sesame dressing. The staff is great about omissions and substitutions - just ask!

Even at regular price, both salads cost less than $9. Un. real.

This place is crowded all the time - we tried to go just when they opened (arriving about 15-20 minutes after dinner opening) but all the tables were taken.  We left our name & phone number and they will call you when a table is available.

The restaurant space is very crowded - tables inside, outside & upstairs and it is cramped!  After a 15-20 minute wait, we were seated - inside the restaurant is nicely decorated & there's tons of chefs in the kitchen (I like how you can see everything in the kitchen area).  We were hungry and ordered lots of food:

-Zippy roll (spicy tuna roll): standard I think
-Right Said Eel roll (freshwater eel roll): also pretty standard - the eel was good.
-Snake roll (eel on top of a CA roll): nicely presented but nothing we haven't seen before =)
-Dracula roll (albacore & blackened ahi inside with fresh tuna on top): I thought being called the Dracula roll there would be some garlic inside but alas no; tasted fine - fish was fresh but I was not blown away.
-Standing Room Only appetizer (baked avocado, eel, crab & tomatoes in eel sauce): Tasted fine but was hard to distinguish the different ingredients - think mashed avocado medley.
-Pan seared scallops w/lemon butter black sesame sauce: my favorite of the night; scallops were large and cooked perfectly with a nice acidic sauce to go with it.
-Godzilla dessert (tempura fried green tea ice cream): pretty good but we've had a better version
-Green tea creme brulee: very good green tea flavor & delicious!

There are some very creative items on the menu but unfortunately, we're not that adventurous.  I see they have oyster shooters & uni shooters too but I don't particularly care for that.  Thinking about it now, we probably should have chosen a less expensive restaurant based on our sushi order.  Nothing was bad...in fact, all of the fish was very tasty & fresh.

When I called to schedule the day and accompanying activities, I advised the experience planning concierge of the gift certificate. She confirmed via email, implying I was good to go. The day came and went, but lo and behold, I was charged the same amount (of the gift certificate) on my credit card. 

Therefore, I was none too pleased to spend unnecessary time out of my day to contact Miraval, communicate the situation, request they use their common sense and apply the funds on the already-paid-for gift certificate for my day package and additional services, and to please refund the amount charged to my card. This was completed in an expedient fashion, but I still had to expend extra energy on my end to watch my statement and ensure the refund posted. It was a frustrating and completely avoidable end to what was supposed to be a relaxing and decompressing day. 

Onto the day itself: I don't know how Miraval manages to have a ""Tucson"" address, because it's a ~30 min drive from Tucson proper, less if you're up north and more if you're coming from the south/east. The resort is actually in the town of Catalina.

The grounds are neatly manicured and tranquil. There are a few babbling brooks for ambiance, I suppose, if you like that sort of thing. I just feel the pools breed mosquitos. Customer service was generally excellent. I really enjoyed the variety of healthy smoothies offered at the Palm Court Cafe. 

The Cactus Flower Restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating; the tables are spaced out, I believe, for social distancing. However, I noted that the tables were kind of sticky, and there were flies I had to constantly shoo off my table and away from my food. I know it's difficult to keep the flies out, especially after the monsoon rains and the fact that the servers have to open doors to serve the folks seated outside, but the flies were a distraction from fully enjoying the meal. 

The meal itself at Cactus Flower left much to be desired. I had the soup du jour, or a tomato barley soup, which was very watery and lacking in much flavor. It felt ""limp"" and kind of like a can of Campbell's soup - all water, hardly any barley, and two token slices of mushroom. For the entree, I ordered the daily chef's creation, a barbecue pork with zucchini and cauliflower puree. There were 3-4 slices of pork (about the size of char siu pork) drizzled with bbq sauce. It was edible but hardly special. There was one okra-size zucchini, all atop a decent puree. Dessert consisted of 2 pistachio chocolate chip cookies. They were good, but it's a juvenile dessert for such an upscale (read: EXPENSIVE) resort. 

The saving grace was the Coyote Moon Bar & Lounge, whose food blew me away. For an afternoon snack, I ordered the black sesame somen, which was incredibly refreshing and tasted authentically and strongly of black sesame. I also got the house cured salmon, which I must say, is probably the best salmon I have ever had in my life. It was very fresh, the texture and flavor were perfect and went swimmingly with the quark creme fraiche. I think the food is all from the same kitchen, so I suppose it just depends on what you happen to order. 

I took a cardio drumming class and strength training class with Da Vinci body boards. The drumming class was fun and worked up a sweat; the body board class was intense and revealed conclusively how out of shape I am. The instructor of the Da Vinci body boards was funny and knows his stuff. My critique is that the room in which these classes take place, in the Body Mindfulness Center, is dated and it's a pretty small space. The locker room can also use a facelift. I don't think the bath towels should give off a light pink hue, but here we are. 

I squeezed in a deep desert massage and probiotic facial. The spa facilities are much better than the BMC - bigger and more updated. It also houses the spa amenities of a dry sauna, steam room (closed b/c of COVID), jacuzzi, and an enclosed outdoor space to lounge and relax. I especially liked the quiet room at the spa: a sitting room with large comfy lounge chairs that face a wall of windows showcasing a view of the mountains. 

My massage with Michael was mediocre. I like DEEP DEEP DEEEEEEP massages. I asked for more pressure, which he verbally acquiesced but didn't physically deliver. My facial was better, but I would've preferred more extractions, as upon inspecting my face afterwards, there could have been more extractions done.

Straight out of a perfect Instagram shot, Cacao 70 has brought its delicious dessert creations here. If you haven't heard of Cacao 70, it's a dessert chain based in Montreal that has expanded throughout Canada. Cacao 70 is well known for their decadent chocolate, such as fondues and hot chocolates. Since the chain has different concepts, the location I visited was their Sweet House concept which serves all-day brunch, dessert, and chocolate drinks. The dessert menu consists of waffles, fondues, crepes, dessert pizzas, and sharing plates. You can also get their signature dipped ice cream and chocolate drinks, available on the go.

This is their first Edmonton location, which is in the back of the Edmonton Tower in the Ice District. Two more locations are planned - one in West Edmonton Mall and the other on Whyte Ave.

My friend and I tried out their fondue and a classic waffle combo. Each of their fondue comes in two sizes and there are so many flavours to choose from! We settled on the smaller size of their matcha chocolate fondue, which was perfect for 2 people. Their other flavours are classic, black & white, triple, coffee, peanut butter, and Earl Grey. The fondue was served with fresh fruit, chocolate brownie pieces, and waffle bites. The matcha fondue itself was creamy and definitely did not lack the matcha taste. It wasn't bitter due to the balance of the chocolate but it was soooo good. I would definitely recommend trying this if you like matcha! They also have a classic waffle with their matcha chocolate called the Catcha Matcha which I'm probably gonna try on my next visit.

Their classic waffle combo definitely did not look like your average dessert waffle. We tried The Blackjack which had a Cacao 70 waffle hidden at the bottom, topped with black sesame chocolate, cheesecake creme brulee, soft serve ice cream, whipped cream, sesame seeds, and a waffle cone. Their Cacao 70 waffle had a slight crisp to it, which paired perfectly with the sesame chocolate and ice cream. I tried to get a bit of everything in each bite. Honestly, I couldn't tell where the cheesecake creme brulee was in this but I think I tasted it?? My friend and I both enjoyed The Blackjack even though it looked overwhelming at first!

This review will be quick, as I have tried almost here dish here.  I come here for very specific items;
1. Wonton/Dumpling in chili oil - mainly for the garlicy chili sauce.  The flavor has become more sweet over the years, sometimes a little too sweet.
2. Sweet Dumplings in soup - This is similar to Tang Yuan, minus the flavored tang.  The ""dumplings"" are chewy rice flour filled with sweet black sesame.  Addictive.
3. Peruvian Apple Herb Jelly - This is similar to Aiyu jelly and good for cooling your body down after eating spicy food.  For those that like the trendy brown sugar syrup flavor (in Tiger Sugar Bubble Drink), then you will like this flavor.  It also has chopped peanuts and raisins.
For the other dishes, I have had them and they are just ok.  There is another restaurant in this plaza that I go to for lamb and janbing.

It is not hard to understand why this restaurant is crowded every night of the year. A two hours wait on the weekend is not uncommon if you arrive after 7. Arigato Sushi has what it takes to appeal to different clientele. Purists could sit in front of the sparkling clean sushi bar and receive full service from the chefs in the authentic style. Couples could enjoy a romantic dinner at the beautiful outdoor patio. The energetic ambiance made it an excellent place to socialize with your friends over a few glasses of cocktails or sake. 

The menu has fusion ingredients written all over. Arigato is not your typical Japanese sushi restaurant featuring some fusion maki. The food here is the child of a Japanese-Californian marriage. Different elements combined seamlessly to enhance the flavor of the fish without stealing any spotlight. Some might find their sauce and garnish on the mild side but I found the lack of distraction very comforting.

The most memorable thing I have ate there is actually the grilled portabella nigiri. A pure vegetarian creation and yet it is not shy in comparison to its seafood siblings. The texture actually resemble a good piece of anago. Quality of their fish is good although still far from what I would consider top tier. Dinner was overall very delightful. I have some complaints but the list is short. Serving sashimi platter on ice might look impressive but the cold temperature numbs the tongue too much and dumb down the tastebuds. Black sesame ice cream was slightly icy. 

It is really worth a 2 hours wait? Hard to say. If you are smart like me, you will get here super early to beat the crowd.",2011-12-08 04:14:47,Arigato Sushi,1225 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,34.4238502,-119.7054774,"Restaurants, Sushi Bars, Japanese, Asian Fusion"

SERVICE - EXCELLENT
Even though it was a Friday night and super busy, we somehow managed to get seated right away.  It was a table close to the door but far enough so that we didn't feel a draft and people couldn't hover over our table.  All night, the manager was very attentive to us.  He was actually our server.  Sometimes service was slow but that's cause the busyness really picked up.  The only negative for the night was that another server checked up on us, we asked for a dessert menu and it never came.

FOOD - VERY GOOD
I won't go into detail about all the things we ordered but here is a list of some:
-Seared Salmon
-Jalapeno Yellowtail
-Pacific Rim Roll
-Fiesta Roll (based on manager's recomendations)
-Sashimi Combo
All the fish was very fresh.  Nothing is as spicy as the menu makes it out to be, even if there is habanero involved.  The only roll that was unpleasant was the Fiesta Roll which contained tempura yellowtail, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado and rice in a soy wrap.  It tasted like a burrito and according to my friends, specifically like a fish burrito.  I think you all would completely agree.  The manager claimed that to be one of his ultimate favorites.  

AMBIANCE - GOOD
Trendy and hip.  There is an outdoor section, an indoor section and an upstairs section.  I love the blurry photographs all around the restaurant but I do not like the almost racist Asian caricature painting on the wall.  They might as well put up a picture of a Japanese guy eating sushi in an internment camp.

DESSERTS - BAD
-Black Sesame Ice Cream
-Tempura Red Bean Ice Cream
-Green Tea Creme Brulee
Do not order any of this.  The black sesame ice cream was probably the best of the three but didn't have enough black sesame flavor.  They probably lighten it up so that it's more likeable among the masses.  The tempura ice cream (red bean) was boring.  The tempura was not crisp and hard to break apart.  I've had better red bean ice cream.  The worst dish was the creme brulee.  I am not a fusion-food-hater but I do believe that people need to still adhere to certain basics of dishes while attempting to morph them.  You can try to break through the torched layer but you will most likely be unsuccessful since it's very bendy and chewy (made from brown sugar).  Once you do get through, the cream was curdling and resembled spinach dip.  Overall, it just didn't taste right.",2008-08-11 16:51:05,Arigato Sushi,1225 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,34.4238502,-119.7054774,"Restaurants, Sushi Bars, Japanese, Asian Fusion"

You won't have any trouble finding parking here, so no hubbub or chaotic mess from State Street.  It's a cute place that features an enclosed patio setting.

It has a little of everything on the breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus.  But the uniqueness comes from the owner that brings a Polynesian/Hawaiian influence.  Want some Kahlua Pork?  Come here.  Want some Spam & Eggs?  Come here.  Want some Bacon Fried Rice?  Yep, come here.

Made with mixed veggies, brown rice, avocado, green onion, black sesame seeds and a sunny side up egg for $10 -- this sounded really good.

Finding good sushi in Santa Barbara (that aren't just rolls or a limited sashimi menu) was a bit challenging, so we were happy to find Arigato.

Located in the heart of downtown SB, Arigato has nice ambiance with a relatively large wraparound sushi bar with 5 sushi chefs. We immediately ordered seared toro and made ourselves comfortable. The toro was a nice cut, although the sauce used overpowered the toro flavor. Next, we ordered hamachi with a black sesame sauce and were impressed by the creativity (we've only seen black sesame in ice cream, not on sushi!) and it was very flavorful. Excited to see Scottish salmon in the menu because it often has a salmon belly-like texture, and it didn't disappoint here either. 

We ordered a salmon skin and grilled lobstertail hand-roll next (yum!) and our sushi chef Demetrio made these beautifully. The salmon skin was more meaty than crispy, but had yummy, juicy flavor. The lobstertail handroll was really unique - with salmon roe, yellow tobiko, black sesame and enoki mushrooms (see pic for the beauty!) We tried the shrimp and halibut gyoza (have never seen these), ameobi shrimp and a soft shell crab handroll too. The gyozas were awesome - great flavor, juicy and a soft texture served with a classic ponzu. The fried shrimp heads were so good that we knew the soft shell crab would be prepared well too. The crab was creamy, salty and delicious.

For dessert, we ordered two more salmon skin handrolls (with sweet unagi sauce) and observant Demetrio made them without the veggies because he noticed we picked them out the first time (they're kind of filler to us!) 

A great choice in Santa Barbara for ambiance, good service (the staff seem to genuinely like each other which adds to the cheery atmosphere), and fun sushi options.

Mike Dancing Pants Roll: Spicy crab meat, avocado, asparagus & shrimp topped with seared sea scallop & special house sauce (I recommend substituting the shrimp for tempura shrimp to add a little texture and crunch to the roll).

What is there not to love about KOREAN food? When done well it tends to have all the perfect elements of the perfect meal.

Take KTown BBQ for instance, as soon as you walk into the door you know you are in for a treat. Your nostrils instantly pick up the aroma of grilled short ribs that have been marinating in special spices for over 24 hours.

Not trying to b racist or one of those other types but you know this the real deal with so many Korean families having lunch here. It is what it is. Its not Americanized and I luv that.

KTown is sort of a mini chain, Sammy Chon has become a pillar of the Korean Community in Philly and he has been able to spread his love across the Delaware into NJ.

He happens to be the creator of the famed Koagie (listed as one of the best sandwiches in America) http://www.endlesssimmer.com/2011/02/28/americas-best-new-sandwiches-part-2/

Shortly after I placed my order a complimentary set of ban-chan was brought to my table. For those that are wondering what that is, its basically small side dishes that complement the main course. Usually anywhere between 6 to 8 small dishes of various flavors that run the gamut from pickled to spicy to sweet all intended to compliment the flavors of the main course.

The LA Kalbi came out shortly after. And boy was it amazing. Some of the best I've had around.

Extremely tender and full of flavor which ranged from garlic, sesame, ginger, scallion and soy. Simply amazing esp the areas that had a bit of char close to the bone. Bliss!!!

What is there not to love about KOREAN food? When done well it tends to have all the perfect elements of the perfect meal.

Take KTown BBQ for instance, as soon as you walk into the door you know you are in for a treat. Your nostrils instantly pick up the aroma of grilled short ribs that have been marinating in special spices for over 24 hours.

Not trying to b racist or one of those other types but you know this the real deal with so many Korean families having lunch here. It is what it is. Its not Americanized and I luv that.

KTown is sort of a mini chain, Sammy Chon has become a pillar of the Korean Community in Philly and he has been able to spread his love across the Delaware into NJ.

He happens to be the creator of the famed Koagie (listed as one of the best sandwiches in America) http://www.endlesssimmer.com/2011/02/28/americas-best-new-sandwiches-part-2/

The take the hoagie tradition of Philly and stuff a bit of Korea into it, literally. Think bulgogi, sesame slaw. Amazing.

I was contemplating having one of those today (9-4-13) But after reviewing the menu and locking my eyes on LA Kalbi I knew instantly what I needed to order.

Shortly after I placed my order a complimentary set of ban-chan was brought to my table. For those that are wondering what that is, its basically small side dishes that complement the main course. Usually anywhere between 6 to 8 small dishes of various flavors that run the gamut from pickled to spicy to sweet all intended to compliment the flavors of the main course.

The LA Kalbi came out shortly after. And boy was it amazing. Some of the best I've had around.

Extremely tender and full of flavor which ranged from garlic, sesame, ginger, scallion and soy. Simply amazing esp the areas that had a bit of char close to the bone. Bliss!!!

NZx0bYMxuRERfnirRH2f-w,7vL-LrMQaCYZSlXS8OVwnA,_WMPvLy9AWk9NoymKpkfhg,5.0,1,0,0,"Apparently, this restaurant has been opened as early as 2011, but it's a wonder how this gem stayed hidden! I had recently heard of this place and my friends were saying that it was hands-down the best ramen in town. Now don't be fooled...it is NOT a ramen restaurant. Disappointing...as they only serve ramen on Saturday mornings (11:30am to 2:00pm), but if you like ramen, you have got to give this place a try!

The portion is a little small compared to other ramen places in the Greater Edmonton Area and the price tag is the same at around $12. Taste-wise, it is the most flavourful broth currently available here. When you order, there are add-ons and I highly recommend adding the egg to your order. Those who don't like their eggs runny should skip this option. For those that love their meat, be warned that a bowl only comes with 1 slice of cha shu (pork), so adding meat may be something you would want to consider.

The noodles are cooked well and are slightly chewy, which is how I love it. One disappointing fact is that the noodles are not handmade by the restaurant. Traditional ramen is supposed to be handmade and paired with a rich pork broth. A plus is that this Japanese restaurant is actually owned by Japanese person, complete with a fluent, English-speaking Japanese waiter. While that doesn't guarantee authenticity or quality, Japanese foodies would know that is a rare occurrence now as most Japanese restaurants are Chinese owned/run.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention the delicious dessert. While most Japanese restaurants serve ice cream mochi, these were the best I have ever had! The rice dough outside layer was very thin and evenly distributed. They allow you to order any mix of flavours within an order. At $5 for 3 mochi, we ordered two orders (two of each flavour - chocolate, black sesame, and green tea). We were still contemplating how to split 6 mochi among 4 people as the order arrived. They had cut them into 12 perfect halves, ready for sharing. Talk about service! The ice cream was creamy smooth inside and were not at all runny from being cut open before serving. Also, the shape of them looks like they had been popped out of a mini muffin tray, which leads me to wonder if they had made it themselves.

All in all, I will definitely be paying Yuzen another visit sometime soon - both for their ramen and to try out the rest of their menu.",2013-01-30 09:48:36,Yuzen Japanese Restaurant,127-1 Hebert Road,St. Albert,AB,53.6224531,-113.6085008,"Ramen, Sushi Bars, Japanese, Restaurants"

It is definitely not for traditionalists.  The bagels are quite good though, as are the egg sandwiches etc.  One issue that almost lost them a star:  poppyseed bagels and not sesame bagels!!  I ordered my egg sandwich on a sesame bagel, and it came on a poppyseed bagel.  Ok, I thought, maybe I made a mistake or was misheard.  But then I opened the bagel bag this morning (I had ordered half-dozen), and in place of the two sesame bagels I ordered were two poppy.  I hate poppyseed bagels, so i know it wasn't me.  Have to edit this - my wife pointed out that they were black sesame seeds on the bagel.  This doesn't make things better - to me, a sesame bagel is a sesame bagel - no need to fix what works!

The japchae was incredible! I mean incredible, the noodles were perfectly boiled and not too soft and soggy. There was a perfect blend of mixing a, finished well with black sesame seeds which made it taste great! 

The Korean fried chicken is awesome, the chicken is fresh, perfectly fried, the spices of the sauce we're great! The chicken managed to remain nice and crispy even at the end of our meal which is pretty rare usually it's soggy within 5 minutes so these guys got it down! Easily earns high marks for this dish alone. 

The bulgolgi was amazing! All agreed much better than Bay Area Korean restaurants... something about it you can tell it's fresh, it's well marinated, and man oh man is it tasty. Little to no fat or tendon, seriously try it! 

Kimchi Spam fried rice I felt was good,  but didn't blow me out of the water.

The tofu soup... we ordered two kinds. Definitely best in town. My sister thought better than most Korean restaurants in the bay. My wife agreed as well. 

The decor inside is very nice and trendy, the bathroom they did a great job at remodeling, fresh smelling with nice new subway tiles on the wall. 

For sure the best Korean restaurant in reno, for sure! I would say better than most if not all sacramento restaurants.

It can also be served as a burrito.  I really liked the way the flavors blended, reminded me of Korean barbecue.  There are three sauces on the tables; modified (kamayan?) soy sauce, fish sauce, and garlic sauce with a pepper in it.  I liked some of the modified soy sauce on the rice.
Also tried the Ube Fries on the side, purple sweet potato fries served with spicy banana ketchup.  I wasn't a big fan of these, the cut was really inconsistent on the fries so some were more cooked than others.

The kitchen is open to the diner's view, separated off by a glass wall. An open kitchen concept is a nice touch for any restaurant and it's a fairly bold move, considering how the kitchen back line can be a place for heated discussions between servers, chefs, and expos. Earls managed this well, however, and it was nice to see both the servers and the chefs on display, since customers rarely get a glimpse of the back-of-house.

We ordered the Prawn Dynamite Rolls to start: maki made from panko breaded prawns, mango, avocado, cucumber, togarashi mayonnaise, maple soy reduction and sriracha mayonnaise, and toasted black sesame seeds. Earls is known for its Prawn Dynamite Rolls - apparently one of the best-selling appetizers on the menu - and it's easy to see why. They're delicious. The sauce reminds me of Mikado's Dragon Sauce (served with the Dragon Eye Rolls), and Earls' sushi fillings are fresh and tasty (the mango is a nice touch). They're perfect to share, as well, giving you a flavourful mouthful without being too filling.

Our entrées included the Cajun Blackened Chicken and the Peppercorn 9oz Certified Angus Beef Top Sirloin. The Cajun Blackened Chicken included a chicken breast cooked in blackening spices and garlic butter, and served with warm potato salad and coleslaw. The chicken, while slightly on the too-salty side, was moist and flavourful, and really exuded that smoky Cajun flavour. The potato salad was one of the best I've ever tasted - warm and rich - and the coleslaw was extremely tasty, even though the mayonnaise was a bit on the heavy side.

The Peppercorn Sirloin was cooked to an impeccable medium rare and was cooked with spicy peppercorns, fresh herbs, and demi-glace, and served with Yukon Gold garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus (the seasonal vegetable). While the peppercorn demi-glace was a bit too thick for my liking (resembling more of a North American-style gravy than a rich, French brown sauce), it complemented the steak nicely and went extremely well with the garlic mashed potatoes. I always love a bit of asparagus, and prefer them on the side of a nice steak, so the vegetables were an excellent pairing choice.

Top off an excellent meal with a couple of delicious gin caesars (served with a dill pickle and a beef jerky stick), and you've got yourself a very favourable dining experience.

One minor negative about our visit was that the service began quite slow, but picked up as soon as we'd received our appetizer. I think the main reason behind that was because two servers weren't sure if we were their table, which explains why our drink order was taken by a different girl than our food order and the rest of the service. This wasn't a problem, though - once the ball got rolling, the service was excellent and attentive for the rest of our meal.

Earls has definitely upped its game in the last several years and deserves to be recognized as in the same category as restaurants such as Joey's and Moxie's. Prices range from $15-25 per person, which is standard for a mid-range casual fine dining restaurant. If you're like me and boycotted Earls back in the early 2000s, I'd recommend giving it a retry - you might just be impressed.",2013-10-11 20:59:20,Earls Kitchen + Bar,13330 50th Street,Edmonton,AB,53.5947017,-113.4153343,"American (New), Comfort Food, Cocktail Bars, Canadian (New), Asian Fusion, Bars, Nightlife, Restaurants, Burgers, Sandwiches"

I tried: kaiso salad with octopus, house tofu (which is cooked tableside), wasabi truffle escargot, wasabi lobster and wasabi tuna sushi rolls, and the special which was soft shell crab. The appetizers were good but not incredible. The soft shell crab was out of this world delicious. The sushi rolls were good, but they had so much going on in them that you couldn't really appreciate the different ingredients. I don't know if they were worth the $19-$24 a roll. I'd say stick with the simpler rolls and just enjoy the incredible quality of fish. 

Then, the desserts. SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT. It is rare for a place like this to have dessert that stacks up to the caliber of its dinner, but wow desserts were probably the best part of this meal. The desserts are all small and come three to an order for $12 so you can sample a few. This was a rare occasion where instead of splitting one or two desserts for the table everyone got their own and it was well worth it. My boyfriend and I shared so I was able to try six desserts and in order from good to greatest they were matcha green tea strawberry cake, bitter chocolate mousse with sea salt, tofu beignets, fluffernutter dumplings, black sesame cheesecake, and yuzu creme brulee. We were all full from dinner but the desserts were so good that we finished them off entirely. 

We also shared two bottles of wine, and the total for 5 people (more than enough food but no leftovers) was close to $500. It is definitely a place fit for a celebration.

To start, we ordered beer and soju to create a cocktail known as somaek, a popular combination in South Korea ($7, 633ml beer, $13, 360ml soju). The 18% ABV spirit is lightly sweet, and the end result is something like a weak boilermaker. Now properly warmed up, we moved on to appetizers.

Crispy pork and veggie pot stickers ($6.95, 8 pieces) were served with a pair of sauces and gone in seconds. A plate-sized scallion and seafood pancake ($14.95) had a crispy, almost hashbrown-like texture, full of long-cut green onion, white fish, octopus, shrimp, and other goodies. Packed with flavor, no sauce necessary.

Ddeokbokki ($12.95) is stir-fried Korean rice cake--something like a fat, spongey pasta--mixed with sweet fish cake, boiled egg, ramen noodle, onion, and cabbage swimming in a pool of sweet chili sauce. It's tasty, but huge. Definitely enough to share with friends. Speaking of huge, Korean fried chicken ($19.95) involves chopping, battering, and deep-frying an entire three pound bird to be served either plain, sweet and spicy, or half and half. It was good plain, but really something with the sauce.

Korean entrees are served with banchan, a series of small dishes intended to enhance the experience. Our lineup included kimchi, spicy daikon radish, sweet fish cake, pickled bean sprout, and a potato salad that was basically chunky mashed potatoes. All were fine, with the kimchi a standout. I do love me some good spicy, fermented cabbage.

A pair of diners ordered hot stone pot rice bowls, one beef bulgogi ($13.95) and the other beef bibimbap ($12.95). The former included marinated beef with mushroom, scallion, onion, carrot, cabbage, and pepper paste; it was quite good. The bibimbap was pretty much the same thing, but with a black sesame seeded fried egg on top, and considerably less beef. We asked why that bowl had just a couple pieces of meat and were told, ""that's how it's served."" I've been served bibimbap at other places with much more meat, so this was a little surprising. Without the meat the bowl was a bit bland and disappointing.

Japchae was next ($11.95), a plate of stir-fried Korean glass noodles with marinated beef, zucchini, mushroom, carrot, and bean sprout. When I've had this as part of banchan it's been very simple, lightly sweet with a lot of herb and fragrant spice. Adding those other ingredients made it something I'd order for lunch every week.

My friend's plate of spicy stir-fried squid ($18.95) included mushroom, scallion, onion, zucchini, and jalapeno, with noodles on the side. The thin strips of mollusc were just about as tender as I've tasted, and the combination of flavors made me wonder if I'd ordered the wrong entree. But I had eyes only for the sundubu soup.

Sundubu is silky soft tofu, and of the soups I chose ""assorted"" ($13.95), which mixed beef, seafood, mushroom, zucchini, and soft tofu, with a fresh raw egg on the side. The soup is served bubbling in a hot stone bowl, so you crack the egg over it and slowly stir as it cooks into the soup. Combined with the velvety tofu, the result is rich, creamy, and delicious.

Horinoya is one of the best places in town for sushi.

That said, even with the limited (and Kosher-style) menu choices, Adsum really needs to ADD SOME (Some food, maybe?) to their restaurant.

I will also qualify my review by saying that the chef is very talented and was so gracious in speaking with our group.  (Why did you give a bunch of pork, clam and sausage (Lamb Merguez) based recipes to a JEWISH group??? Weird.) He really knows his stuff, though.  The service was also good (save for our new - 3 weeks only - server - who made a few bumbles along the way.)

We started with a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the 100% butter (or is it Bibb?) lettuce salad (absolutely no crunch, kinda limp feeling) with delicious asian pears and honey/cayenne candied nuts.  Crumbled of Maytag Bleu cheese on top and a delicious dressing (Sweet) with black sesame seeds. (This is where our server said they were peppercorns.  Sorry, not true.)
The salad - while good in concept was really boring and unsatisfying to eat.   Salade Ennuis.

Now I am hungry.

The entree was sized like a large app.  3 ricotta filled ""gnuddi"" (Think Gnocchi crossed with ravioli) were delicious sitting atop a zesty lemony-cream.  But the 6 small bites (about 2 per gnocchi) were not enough.  There was also (5 star!) one - just one - fried green tomato presented with an olive oil powder on top.  I got tons of the powder, while my friend next to me had a light dusting.  I think because my tomato had so much powder I could detect a slight ""chemical aftertaste"" from it.  (The ""top note - was great - a dry, green olive oil.)

I would have bet money that somehow liquid nitrogen was involved. I'd have lost money.  They make the Olive oil powder by centrifuging the Olive oil with a malto-dexttin aggregate or something. Maybe that accounts for the chemical aftertaste?

I am getting over the whole ""molecular gastronomy"" fad very quickly.
I am also not a big lover of sous-vide (so much of it is done poorly), but that is the subject for another review.

The other entree choice was a single (JUST ONE) deep-fried cod fritter.  Not my bag, baby.

Delicious gnuddi - just not enough food.

Now I am STARVING...

So dessert comes, and it is GINORMOUS.  (Nice salad, tiny entree, huge hunk of chocolate cake) and so dense and cold and rich you can barely eat it with a spoon. My friend wanted a knife - as did I.)

So I ate 2 bites of the chocolate cake, and felt my blood sugar spike almost instantly.

Not fun.  I boxed up the rest for my 6 year old to enjoy later.

For $46 per person??  I guess that's fair - if you had eaten an actual entree. (Salad, app, huge dessert.)

I literally had to eat a bowl of strawberries at 11:30 PM when I got home. I hate eating late at night but I was absolutely famished.

I am very, very disappointed with Adsum.
That said - the regular menu (Foie gras poutine?  The SUPER Poutine is like a platter of pure fat in many forms.) doesn't really do it for me either.

Sorry Adsum.

So why 3 stars? Well, 2 stars for the quality of fish and taste of rolls. 5 stars for dessert creativity and taste. I was more blown away by the dessert than the sushi. Minus a star for pricing that doesn't match up to expectations of fish quality. 

The sushi was alright. I have had better fish in California, but they do pay attention to details. Presentation was spectacular if that's what you're into. However, it seems more fusion than Japanese. (Hint: Japanese people don't ever use extra virgin olive oil on their rolls.) To give them credit, the special rolls were pretty creative. 

Dessert was amazing! The mochi was housemade and we got the black sesame and salted caramel mochis. Both were fantastic! I was really blown away by the salted caramel mochi! Yuzu creme brûlée was also superb!

During Restaurant Week, we visited a number of restaurants near our offices during lunch. This was one of them. Restaurants in this area tend to be understandably busy during lunch, but this was the only place where we found absolutely no sense of urgency in taking care of customers. When we came in, a lot of tables were filled, but they were definitely not jam-packed the way other places were. There was no one at the host stand, which was fine for the first 5 minutes, but after that, we were confused as to whether we should just seat ourselves at the bar. It seemed staff working near the entrance were actively avoiding our glance. 

The restaurant is pretty small, so I could clearly see the hostess walking slowly back and forth between the tables. When she saw us, she continued to slowly walk back and forth between tables around the room. The manager, who was standing at the food window closer to the entrance, also saw us, but he stood perfectly still, looked away, and did not tell any member of his staff to go greet us. These folks really take the Zen concept to the next level!!!

Once we finally got seated at the sushi bar, the service was okay (it existed, but was not particularly remarkable). The RW lunch options were pretty decent, except for dessert. We got edamame, udon noodle soup (very tasty!), salads, and bento boxes containing shrimp/veggie tempura and simple selections of maki rolls and sashimi, which tasted very fresh. For dessert, we had a piece of black sesame mochi ice cream and 2 small pieces of rice crispy treat rolled up like sushi, which can either be found in the frozen section of an Asian supermarket or be created cheaply at home. 

I had been here before during HH, and I remember the food being tasty, but underwhelming when factoring in the price.

I picked the garden vegetable cream cheese and the lady recommend the vanilla honey as well for a savory and sweet option. They were about  $6.50 / half pint, not $3.00 which was not written clearly on the blackboard (it threw me off guard when my total was $27).

The service was quick, 5 minutes and I was out. Everyone at the meeting loved the bagels and couldn't stop eating them. The cream cheese qas so delicious that I wish I wasn't so full so that I could continue eating.

the bagels and CCprice is pretty steep, at 3.50- but well worth a try..

We both liked the decor of the place. It almost had a steampunk-vibe. We both had appetizers (my fiancee had the cornbread; I had the deviled eggs.) While the eggs were tasty, I nabbed a couple fork-fulls of cornbread and wished I'd gotten that one like I started to. I absolutely love cornbread and the jalapeno butter they used was a nice flavorful touch. It also wasn't overly spicy, which I liked.

For entrees, she got the salmon and I opted for scallops. I can't really tell anymore if scallops are indicative of what a restaurant as a whole can do from a culinary standpoint because I feel like scallops are really hard to mess up. I always worry that the scallops won't be very filling but my concerns proved to be unfounded. The dish was filled with great vegetable choices and a smear of squash puree. I ate everything on my plate. So good. I tried a little bit of my fiancee's salmon dish and wasn't that impressed. If I remember correctly, it was seared with black sesame so one side looked like it had been dipped in tar. To be honest, it kind of tasted like it was a little on the burnt side. Glad I chose the scallops in this case because I think the salmon was in my top 3 choices when ordering. However, my fiancee LOVED the salmon totally, so different strokes on that one. 

Speaking of ordering, our server wasn't that great. When I was deliberating which one of two entrees I was considering, he was kind of flippant in his response and I could tell the last thing he wished to do was actually offer his opinion on a dish so I chose the scallops. But throughout the night, he hardly said anything. Never asked how we were doing. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert, just threw the menu down and strolled off. 

If there was a way we could have tipped the kitchen and not him, I would have done it. 

Overall, the food was fantastic and I would like to go back again and try a different entree this time.

Otherwise, your options are do the best you can and then wander for blocks through an interesting neighborhood until you arrive at a black box. Enter. Yes, it's like breaking into Al Capone's safe because the interior is all black but inside you are safe and welcome even though it feels like you put on your burqa backwards. 

The room is one dark, black cube with a small elliptical spirited Bar and a long Chef's Bar in front of a huge buzzin' kitchen. 

A background rock loop blends easily with the sound of communal dining. 

The Vibe: Philly's culinary adventurers. A congenial group who tried Monday through Thursday to get into Friday, Saturday and Sunday without success.  

The Staff: The Servers are overflowing with Brotherly love but although you are inches from the line cooks, they don't get out of line to chat. In fact they won't have anything to say to you unless you're related or they owe you money.

The Bar: It's as innovative as the food. 6 signature cocktails plus the usual suspects, (Wine and Beer) all on the wall along with dinner specials and thankfully all on the menu ""B"" side as the wall is too hard to see. Trump should be working on this wall. 

I had a My Session (could be my new obsession). This featured Dry Sherry, China in China, (Orange Bitters) and Passion Fruit about which I happen to be passionate. This was deep and delicious with rich notes of each of the 3 stars making it a 5 star libation. 

And just to test the system, I asked for a Whiskey Sour on the double which was double strength and finished double quick leaving me seeing me double in short order. Absolutely wonderful, it was. 

The Food: Wowser. It was positively sublime which is not easy to do in a town with Chef's as creative and daring as the Founding Fathers, all of whom would have bribed anyone to get a table here. 

I had no idea what to expect. Serpico? Basic Italian food for dirty cops? Non c'e modo. 

A wannabe Papadum (razor thin Rice Crackers) magically appeared and disappeared immediately. Studded with Black Sesame Seeds, you dip it into soft Cultured Butter with Cracked Pepper, or better, the Black Bean Dip with Cotija Cheese and Micro Cilantro. Get some under your nails for later. 

The Raw Diver Scallops were laid to rest in Buttermilk, Poppy Seeds, Green Yuzo Kosho, White Soy, and Chives when it arrives. It didn't stay long either. One bite and it was hoovered and savored. These silky smooth Scallops sported a unique presentation, were simply divine and gone as quick as a White House appointee.  

The Lettuce Salad is not a adequate name for such a beautiful composition of Micro Greens, Snow Peas, Smoked Lamb Bacon, Mint, Chervil, Lime and hand torn Nori dusted Croutons all judiciously bathed in a creamy Citrusy Dressing. A must. 

Fried Duck Leg riffed on a Hot Dog. Hoisin Sauce slathered on a mini Martin's Potato Bun with paper thin Cucumber coins, Scallions and a micro dot of Garlic Chili Sauce (Sriracha...I saw the bottle come out from under the counter). Everyone in the place had one for good reason. Party food rocks and this Duck rocked hard. 

The Chicken Snail Lasagna with Bechamel Sauce, Hazelnuts, Parsley, Pesto dots and Yuzu. Order this for sure if only because you won't find anything like this anywhere else. (Okay, Nightshade in LA does a Mapo Tofu Lasagna which compares favorably to this, except it's in LA). 

This dish was as brilliant as the idea to make it in the first place. 

Crisp Porchetta was a deconstructed version of a traditional belly beater. This was shredded Pork long braised to tenderness and then topped with a crown crackin' Cracklin' and treated to a few squirts of house made Pear Mustard. I had to rethink my devotion to a Stuffed Pork Sandwich as fat as a Whoopie Cushion on a crunchy Ciabatta Roll. 

Julienned Pickled Daikon replaced mundane Cole Slaw. Aw shucks the Porchetta was all so magnificently rich and satisfying, I defy any Vegan to resist it.

And now it's time for dessert. 

The Apple Cake was disguised Sticky Toffee Pudding. Dulce de Leche replaced melty Treacle. 
Burnt Apple Sauce pooled under the mound next to house made Vanilla Ice Cream topped with Shortbread Crumbles. Sweet!

The Vanilla Panna Cotta with fresh Berries, Candied Almonds and Yuzu will make you believe you are light.

We ordered a jasmine green tea, which was perfect since it was quite chilly that day. My mom has high standards for teas and this one passes the mark! We also ordered the Trio with Black Sesame Creme brûlée, Green tea fancier, and the Fruit Tart. 

The black sesame creme brûlée was DELISH. Not too sweet but strong black sesame flAvor - definitely interesting and unique.  

Green Tea Fancier was great! Reminiscent of a green tea muffin, which a slightly crisp muffin top but soft pillowy inside. 

Fruit tart wasn't too sweet. The cream didn't have too much flavor and acted more as a vessel to highlight the fruit. It was good but nothing to put in the books.

Since then I have discovered the beauty of their weekly specials which are simply put, special! The specials can be sweet, savory, or anything in between. It always fun to order the special bagel and cream cheese combo just to see how delicious it will be. I also love the togarashi with scallion lime cream cheese (which I've also started adding a pickled green tomato to at the suggestion of my friend). The spicy togarashi with the sharp but cooling cream cheese is too good. I will also deeply miss the chicken salad sandwhich and tuna salad sandwhich, both of which are so creative and flavorful. The chicken salad is so fresh and there are never any bites of gristle (I'm a big texture person).

Clean: My first impression of this place is...it's clean. With Covid still being around, the two employees that I saw do have their masks on. However, there are no tables if you want to enjoy and eat their mochi donut or try out their drinks inside the store. 

Mochi Donuts: They taste fresh to me. There are a number of flavors to choose from. And from time to time, they will have new flavors out. The day I was there they had Ube and Mango as their new flavors. Their normal selections I believe are Strawberry, Matcha, Oreo, Nutella, Coffee, Brown Sugar Milk Tea, Black Sesame, Coconut, etc. I've tried all except Matcha. Personal preference that I would recommend is heat the mochi donut for a few seconds before eating so the texture of the mochi would be soft and chewy.

It's fairly large, with what seemed like about 75 or 100 seats, or so, no counting the al fresco seating which is another 20 or so.   Most of their options are spicy, so if you're not a fan of spicy Szechuan, this may not be the pace for you, though they do have options for the spice-averse among us...myself included.  I opted for their Hot Pot, which is similar to a Japanese Shabu Shabu or a fondue.  They have an interesting take on this, as you choose your broth (pork, chicken, veggie, or spicy chili) along with as many of about 30 veggie and protein options as you like.  For proteins they had pork, beef, lamb, fish, lobster (fake) balls, fish balls, ""luncheon"" meat (spam), as well as some items that had a surcharge like clams, oysters, head-on shrimp, and lobster.  They had several kinds of tofu, as well as napa cabbage, soy bean sprouts, spinach, mushrooms, etc., and three kinds of noodles:  vermicelli, udon, and a ramen/soba hybrid.  You can choose two kinds of broth if you like, but I opted for the basic chicken.  I ordered a chrysanthemum strawberry tea, which came iced, and was great if not just a bit on the sweet side.  

They brought a butane burner to the table, atop which was placed the simmering broth.  The chicken broth was simmering with some green onions, mushrooms, tomato, and goji berries.  They also bring three dipping sauces:  peanut (savory), barbecue (savory), and a garlic oil.  I got some chili oil on the side, as well.  

The proteins and veggies arrive on a large plate, the noodles on another, and you place the raw food in the simmering broth to your desired level of doneness.  They provide a small spider with which you retrieve the items once they're cooked to your liking.  It's nice, because you can cook everything just until it's done, then pull it out.  I especially liked the fact that the noodles came dry, so when you cooked them for six or seven minutes, they came out of the broth infused with the stock...very tasty. Overall, it's a fun dinner option and great for a group of people to dine together and try new foods.  

For dessert, I opted for an unusual dish called sesame dough soup.  It was, quite possibly, the strangest thing I've ever eaten...not so much for the ingredients, but more the presentation and taste.  The ""soup"" is a very watery base with very little taste, seemingly flavored with goji berries and I'm not sure what else.  The dough balls are glutinous rice balls stuffed with a black sesame paste.  The taste was ok, however as you eat the dish, especially if you cut the balls in half in the soup, it literally looks as if someone dumped an ashtray into the soup bowl; the sesame paste looks exactly as you'd think cigarette ashes would look if dumped in a bowl of water.  A very interesting dish that was visually horrible; the taste was not enough to my liking that I'd try it again, though it's a great dish to try with a bunch of people to see their reactions.  

I can't comment on the prepared dishes, since I only had the hot pot, but from what I could see, people seemed to be enjoying their dinners.  I'd definitely go back and try some other dishes, and I'd definitely re-visit for the hot pot.

I read all the Yelp reviews, became skeptical, but was game, 'cause he'd been here before and liked it.

We were greeted by two guys behind the counter, and they were smiling. THAT is important.

Guerrilla Street Food serves Filipino-American food -- something of which I know nothing.

But I know a clean restaurant when I see it. It was immaculate, except for where we sat. More on that later.

Our order-taker helped us so much with explanations of the general Filipino food being not ridiculously hot of spice, as well as specifics about certain dishes and how they are arranged on the menu board. Most popular five dishes are first. He was incredibly helpful.

We ordered:
Shanghai Lumpia -- $3 -- Ground pork, onion, garlic, carrot, in a thin wrapper and fried. Served with chile sauce.

Flying Pig -- $8 for regular, $10 for large -- Pulled pork shoulder with hoisin, sriracha and calamansi over steamed jasmine rice. Topped with a slow-cooked egg, fried garlic, black sesame and green onion.

Wandering Pig -- $7 for regular, $9 for large -- Pulled pork shoulder with hoisin, sriracha and calamansi over steamed jasmine rice. Topped with fried garlic, black sesame and green onion.

We both ordered the large of our dishes and opted for water -- and virtually (and I'm using that word appropriately) when we got settled with our water on two bar seats facing Delmar, the food was delivered.

Both of our entrees were served in large bowls -- my bowl was on a tray, because that housed the Shanghai Lumpia and sauce in a container that we were sharing.

I was the Flying Pig and immediately pierced the runny yolk. And it ooozzzed beautifully throughout the dish along with some black sesame seeds.

He was the Wandering Pig -- same dish without the egg.

We ate, we talked, we shared the Lumpia. We ate, we talked.

The Shanghai Lumpia were tremendous. They were soooo hot and fresh out of the fryer when they came to the table, we had to let them cool down a bit, so we didn't burn our lips off. That's NOT a bad thing in my book.

Crunchy on the outside and NOT greasy, good innards. The chile sauce was sweet with a good back-heat, but not too much. I didn't count the pieces of lumpia, but I thing it was five or six. These are small rolls.

He was skeptical on the Lumpia, but he tasted one, dipped in the sauce. Then he tasted another one, dipped in the sauce, and he was sold.

Flying Pig and Wandering Pig -- only separated by a soft-cooked egg.

We both liked our dishes. I didn't taste his, and he didn't taste mine, so we didn't have comparisons.

I was amazed at the flavor and the lovely. A HUGE amount of shredded and flavorful pork in my Flying Pig. It was ridiculously wonderful. And the broken egg went down to flavor the other ingredients. The garlic wasn't overly present. The green onion was perfectly present.

I LOVE GARLIC, so I would have appreciated more. But that's my own personal preference.

This market it HUGE!!!!  It literally feels as if you are transported to another world.  Inside there is a jewelry store, a cell phone store, an Asian bbq (cash only), and a Vietnamese restaurant.  The pork and duck at that BBQ looks ah-mazing!  

It is brightly lit, with wide aisles and for an Asian market I think it smells just fine.  Each aisle is labeled Indian, Korean, Japanese, Hawaiian....they even have my coconut syrup- I have never seen it outside of Hawaii (well, its also at G and L market)

Make sure you get some coconut rolls, they are brought in from a Chinese bakery in Cali and they are super tasty.  You can also find unique items like grass jelly.  

They do have booze, but you can get wayyy better deals elsewhere.  What you do buy here is fresh herbs!  Cilantro, basil, mint, dill, bitter leaves for 20 cents to 50 cents for a large bag.  Also, check the discounted produce.  I got 2 pineapples for a buck, 4 guavas for a bucks....perfect for juicing!  No 10 percent discount on the already reduced items, but everything else in the store is 10 percent off.

I am almost afraid to type this, but the meat here is outstanding.  I do not want the cat out of the bag, but here it goes.  You can get the tastiest beef tenderloin for 7.99 a pound.  I am salivating just writing about it.  If you are adventurous they have the black silkie chicken too!  I had no idea that Tori Spelling's adorable fluffy pet chickens were black underneath....

The freezer section has some really cool stuff like mochi, Thai tea Popsicles, black sesame Popsicles, cheese kulcha and Medhu wada (lentil donuts with coconut chutney)...

Spices are a steal too!  Garam masala, fennel powder, kashmiri pepper powder and all under 4 bucks for about 3 cups worth of spice....fyi- you can turn these spices into the best Chicken Tikka Masala ever!  

I also stock up on my Thai supplies...trust me Chaokah is the BEST coconut milk and Maesri makes the best curry pastes...combine these with palm sugar and tamarind paste, you will have your significant other impressed and dazzled by your culinary craftiness.

My only beef is the Japanese candy section blows....I cannot seem to get my j-pop fix anywhere in this state.

If I were to correlate some to celebrities, ice cream shops would be like your sweet romantic comedy actors/actresses , steakhouses would be like your meaty action stars , and food trucks would be your Indie up and comers or niche actors/actresses.  

Once in a blue moon you come across a polymath, which wikipedia defines as ""a person whose expertise spans a significant number of different subject areas--such a person is known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems""  The first celebrity that comes to mind is Steve Martin.   Steve Martin is not only a comedic genius, but he holds his own as a reputable banjo player in his own band and a New York Times bestselling author and playwright. 

I would consider the baker behind the counter at ICI to be a polymath considering the fact she is not French, came into the business from an accounting background, but was able to use her exacting nature to devise some of the best macarons, croissants, as well as other pastries and coffee I have come across on the East coast, considering my top beloved joints mainly lie in San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle.  

While its namesake highlight the macarons and the coffee, the unspoken star as many others have pointed out are the croissants, the cream filled cruffins, and the kouign amann.  If there was a Richter scale for the degree of shatter between the laminations of butter and pastry biting into a croissant, the croissant at ICI would register a 7.4, well worth the caloric indulgence.  The fact that the baker is Asian carries an additional infusion of sophisticated flavors-twists such as green tea, peanut-black sesame,  and lychee/mancho/passionfruit in her other creations, but the technical mastery and blueprint behind every item is still indisputably French.

To paraphrase a compliment David Chang gave to one of his favorite  Tokyo yakitori joints in his Ugly Delicious series, ""The greatest compliment that I can give is that when I am eating, I am already planning in my head my next trip returning for another meal"".  That is how I feel whenever I come to Philly and have the opportunity to drop in since I am already planning the next pastry I want to try on my next visit as I eat the one I just purchased.",2018-08-10 16:08:45,ICI Macarons & Cafe,230 Arch St,Philadelphia,PA,39.9519105,-75.1443815,"Desserts, Bakeries, Food, Coffee & Tea, Specialty Food, Macarons"

It was tough to choose, we were so tempted to buy a dozen of bagels, and so we did- a dozen of different varieties and we got an extra one for free.

Their bagels specialties includes black sesame, pastrami spiced, everything, poppy seed, and cardamom bagel, my favorite- that should be their calling card with the exotic flavor, absolute perfection!
Along with the insanely-good cream cheese spreads and schmears from the plain cream cheese, to the flavored ones i.e:  roasted tomato, cinnamon raisin and the scallion lime cream cheese, which was a vote-winner. If you're feeling adventurous, I suggests their smoked chopped liver cream cheese!

The bagels were rich, glossy with a golden glow, and always fresh out of the oven. Crispy and crunchy from the outside, dense and chewy from the inside- no need to be toasted and make one of the most perfect bites! What a delight!

Since my friend and I was a little hungry we went with the Chicken Katsu Sandwich was delicious. The chicken was fried nicely and still juicy inside. Nicely seasoned as well. The flavoring was on point and the sauce on the chicken was delicious. Everything is held together by a delicious butter brioche bun.

The salad on the side was well a simple salad nothing special. Not too sure what kind of dressing they used, a little similar to honey mustard taste but very mild.

Onwards to the dessert. The Purple Yam Mille Crepe Cake was pretty good. This type of flavor is usually very mild, but I felt like this one was a bit too mild in flavor. The layers itself are very nicely done and soft, piled high, and easily cut through. Still a very delicious cake.

Trio Combo Mix and Match is a great sampler platter. Very aesthetically pleasing to the eyes and pictures. The green tea financier has a hint of green tea on a soft and warm cake. Very light and slightly moist. It definitely goes well with the tea they have.

The Pate a Choux Chocolate Ice Cream was just as delicious. Very crunch pastry on top that complements the rich chocolate ice cream.

Lastly the Goma Brûlée. It might not look the most appealing, but it was delicious. It still has the nice hard caramelization on top and underneath is the black sesame filling. Delicious and smooth as it enters your mouth and coats your tongue with the flavor of black sesame. The filling is a little thick but it isn't a big deal.

First of all, this location is very easy to find and parking was plentiful. We were excited to find a Filipino food place in St. Louis. We walked inside through the ADA accessibility entrance ramp. Inside can fit up to 20 people. It is very clean and nicely decorated with a Filipino modern vibe. The menu is very straightforward and easy to read. 

We ordered the Large 800 Pound Guerrilla and the sinigang. The 800 Pound Guerrilla is a combination of their Flying Pig (12 hr braised pork shoulder, pulled and sauced with sriracha, hoisin, and calamansi, topped with a 63 degree egg, fried garlic, black sesame seeds) & Chicken Adobo (chicken thighs braised in sou sauce, cider vinegar, garlic, black peppercorn, bay leaves) served with jasmine rice and scallions. 

As we waited for our food, I viewed the other menu items and was excited to come back and try the other food items. However, when our food was brought to us, there was a hair in our sinigang. We sent it back and a new one was made for us and we were reimbursed for it. But, when we did send it back, the cook didn't even say sorry, he just said he'll reimburse us and make us another one. 

The 800 Pound Guerrilla was decent. In my opinion it was too much sriracha. I loved the Flying Pig side, especially the eggs. The chicken adobo was not what I was expecting. It was a lot sweeter than I was used to. I make adobo at home and have no idea which ingredient could have made it taste like that. Probably an unstated ingredient. 

The sinigang had radishes in it, which is different, but not in a good way. The soup was very sour/salty/spicy? The taste was not tolerable. 

The food portions are big. My husband and I shared and there is free water is available. The noise level when we got there was silent, no music, and then one of the workers turned on Country music... which is off from the Filipino decor and food. 

I love the idea of this restaurant but the food did not deliver.

When I moved to St. Louis several years ago and found out that there were no Filipino restaurants, I was super depressed. The Guerrilla Street Food Truck helped some, but now I can finally say that we have a Filipino restaurant in STL thanks to their new location in Tower Grove!!!! 

They have several items to choose from on their menu, including both traditional and newer Filipino dishes. Although I am sad that they do not serve Lechon Paksiw or Sinigang, I was super pleased to see both Pancit and Lumpia. 

For lunch, I ordered The Flying Pig, which you can get either as a bowl or as a burrito. I got it as a bowl and it comes with slow roasted pork asado, chilis, calamansi, sriracha served over rice, and is topped with a 1 hour egg. It was absolutely delicious. The best part is definitely the 1 hour egg. SO good! It was also a really good size and very filling. I tried the Fresh Lumpia, which was good with the sweet sauce. I think next time I'll have it fried. My friend ordered another favorite of this place, which was The 800 lb. Guerrilla. It also comes as a dish or as a burrito. It is a combination of chicken adobo and slow roasted pork, calamansi, sriracha, hoisin, fried garlic, paprika creme, greens and black sesame seeds, and was also topped with a 1 hour egg. 

To drink, my friend had the Calamansi Cooler. It is a house-made limeade with calamansi (an Asian lime), honey, fresh ginger, and mint. We both thought it was a little sweet. I ordered a drink that was made with coconut milk, pineapple juice, and black currant juice. It was OK (not my favorite), but I appreciated that it was free because I checked in on Yelp.

Eating here is not just about the food, it's about the experience. Every dish was delicious and beautiful, and the atmosphere pulls it all together. My one big complaint about the decor is the big glowing phalice in the middle of the table... made arranging dishes on the table precarious and the celebratory birthday photo of us at the table took an unintended turn for the risque ;)

The tuna pizza was so good; I'm not usually big on the raw fish and almost stole some of hubby's slices after finishing my own. My curiosity to see tofu made table-side made me order the yosedofu; it was cool, very silky, not the most flavorful but good. He got the chef's selection sushi platter which was so much food. I got the ishi yaki buri bop; came in a beautiful presentation that involved more table-side prep, was ridiculously delicious, and still yummy the next day when I finished off the leftovers. 

The black sesame moussecake was again ordered partly out of curiosity, and was very good. They even had a candle on the plate for hubs to blow out =)

I also like my food seasoned aggressively. In short this is a can't miss for price + food quality + service + ambiance. A lot of the restaurants in Seminole Heights come across as a bit ""trendy snobby"", not this place. It's unpretentious and comfortable. The menu didn't have a dish I wouldn't try.

We started with the cobia collar and the scallop crudot. Our favorite was the cobia but the scallop dish was really good. How can you go wrong with a fried collar? The pickled turnip and radish were nice and nouc man rounded out the dish. The spicy greens and black sesame seeds make the scallop dish. We moved on to the boar chop and the braised shank. Both dishes were very good. I will say that the star of both wasn't the proteins (although they were well done). I've always said you can tell the best restaurants by what they pair with the proteins and the care taken in preparation. These were spot on, damn delicious, and I wouldn't change a thing. We had a dessert and it rounded out the meal.

We left full but comfortable. I thought the portion sizes were perfect and priced well, especially given the quality. One of the things I really hate is leaving with a ""doggie bag"", leaving food on the plate, or being full before the main arrives. I completely disagree with reviews that the portions are too small or too expensive.

I was poised to like it (I'd even had dreams about kaiten sushi places, being totally enchanted with the conveyor belt concept), but I had no idea I'd love it as much as I do.  There's always fresh sushi, reasonably priced, whirling around on the belt. As a small person who doesn't always get bang-for-buck at any kind of buffet, this place really suits me.You just eat as much as you want and only pay for what you take. I've stuffed myself for $25, and it was a damn sight better than any sushi buffet I've tried here before.

I prefer nigiri and sashimi, which are always fantastic here, but the rolls I've had are delicious too (I don't find them messy myself--most are bite-sized). The fish is always firm, so you won't have to struggle to take a bite of the larger nigiri and sashimi pieces, and the prepared rice is perfect. I like that I don't always recognize what I'm picking up, as it has caused me to be more adventurous in my sushi consumption. I've tried many things now that I never would have ordered off a menu, and I really appreciate that. I love that I can order all-yam tempura and not bother with those other inferior vegetables (and there's plenty of flavour in the tempura sauce--I don't know why the batter would need to be saltier). And get the black sesame ice cream. It's heavenly.

The service is lovely and the fish is of a high quality (at least for Edmonton), and it seems to me they're just figuring out a few kinks--like how many customers to expect on certain nights of the week.

Some highlights:
1. Duck Duck Duck: Duck prepared 3 ways - fried rice, seared, and pan-fried.  The rice was excellent albeit greasy and the medium rare duck was tender and flavorful.  Very solid.
2. Sea bass in citrus vinaigrette: Very tender and flavorful with a slightly sweet and savory vinaigrette.
3. Seafood Toubayan: This was one of my favorites.  It came with fresh, HUGE pieces of king crab, shrimp, scallops, clams, and oyster mushrooms, topped with bok choy, all in a savory butter sauce.  It's served with sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf that pairs extremely well with the butter sauce.  Delicious!

The setting: warm and welcoming. But what are we really here for, but the palate pleasing palette of delicious, diverse cuisine.  Ten courses, each uttelyr different and completely satisfying.

 Homemade rosemary bread with amazingly flavorful chanterelle butter to break the fast.  Then a panoply of starters - cool and refreshing Edamame Hummus studded with black sesame, brightened with a touch of chili oil and eaten with a light rice cracker; a lemon leek ricotta gnudi dressed with peeled tomato and fresh oregano; and a flavorful salad of lettuces in a puff pastry with sweet nubs of pineapple and crunchy hazelnut. 


The perfectly cooked Thai scallop with a fragrant and dizzyingly delicious curry-coconut sauce with mango, basil and mint was a showstopper, and I almost halted the meal right there since all I wanted was a full plate of this wonderful dish.  But more was still to come.  We moved to red wine when the tender wild boar was served with a braised mustard seed sauce, shiitake mushrooms and fava beans.   Again, my eyes closed with pleasure as I tasted the escargot in a 'good to the last drop' sauce of zinfandel, parmesan and basil.  We took a breath with the refreshing cantaloupe sorbet perfectly matched with cucumber water, a surprising, cool combination.  The perfectly cooked black pearl salmon with Bernaise sauce, a poached egg and Ossetra came next followed by tender free range Australian lamb with tabbouleh, pine nuts and white bean garnish. 


The cheese course was a melted base of Camembert de Normandie with a jellied strawberry and rhubarb flavored with balsamic and thyme.  The chef proved that he also masters chocolate with a rich square of dark chocolate ganache brightened with passionfruit, softened with buttermilk and garnished with edible wild flowers.  But my favorite was the 'finger likin' good' foie gras twix with a slight taste of dulce de leche and a white chocolate crunch candy.

I don't even like to talk about it when brought up by other locals and usually say it's like a bad breakup. I grew up in the riverbend area and have had a love affair with ninjas since it opened its doors at their first location on Jeannette street. I have loved it so much I HAD to go at least once a week for my fix. BUTTT unfortunately ever since the new ownership, it's declined. The place is ALWAYS empty even on a Saturday night when it used to be packed, so that's the first clue it's declined. Ever since the new ownership, some of my favorite rolls/ recipes have changed. Now I am all about the raw fish, as long as it's fresh it's hard to mess that up, but honestly one of my favs was just their crunchy  roll/special crunchy. I LOVED it, and I loved it wasn't the same old generic over mayo snow crab with crap tempura flakes pushed to the side instead of mixed together. . It used to be shredded imitation crab mixed all together with tempura flakes, smelt roe, and their awesome egg sauce, again, MXED ALL TOGETHER with asparagus! Perfection! No more . Also their snow crab and spicy snow crab WAS amazing not mayo filled, and had black sesame seeds mixed in. But they changed that too, and now it's mayo filled generic that you can get at every other sushi place. So needless to say since most rolls have crunchy filling or snow crab in them, they have ruined all my favorite rolls.

We had actually taken them off of our list because we got some ehh reviews. What brought us in was an appetizer we had at Drafts for Crafts at the museum, which was their blue cheese and some sort of chipotle mayo with a perfectly fried oyster. Obviously that was SOOOO GOOD that we just had to go to Mopho immediately after on the following night. 

We started with the chicken wings and shrimp and pork spring rolls. The chicken wings are to die for and are fun and messy, perfectly crispy, and tossed in a sauce I wanted to bathe in. The spring rolls are probably the best I've had at a restaurant, they're perfectly wrapped and filled with a delicious fresh combo of veggies, paired with a nice thick peanut sauce. After that we ordered our entrees. I got the tofu and cauliflower rice bowl with a fried egg and it was exactly what I wanted. It was light and filling at the same time and the tofu was crunchy without being dry. I definitely will have a hard time trying anything else because it was so good that I want to order it again and again. My dad got the oyster poboy (a take on Bahn mi) but did not share a single bite because he wasn't willing to part with it. That's a lot for a man who has never really liked Vietnamese food!

So when I learned that his restaurant was based in Philly, I was super excited to make a reservation. So how was dinner you ask? Well, it freakin' kicked culinary butt.

I was a little hesitant about ordering the Omakase (the tasting menu) because I'm not a fan of raw fish, but I really wanted to order the Omakase because I wanted to experience Morimoto's talent and depth. When I asked the waiter if I could do the tasting menu sans sashimi, his answer was a confident, ""Don't worry, I'll take care of you."" And boy, did he ever. The lesson here: if you're going to be dining at an Iron Chef's restaurant, trust the Iron Chef and his staff completely.

The bf and I went with the $120 menu (there was also an $80 menu) because we wanted ""the higher quality ingredients."" Yes, the lobster and the kobe beef were worth the extra $40.

1st course
mine: a HUGE chunk of fresh snow crab mixed with crunchy fried scallions and topped with buttery avocado (you know how much work it takes to retrieve that much crab meat from a crab?)
the bf: tuna tartare + caviar (his favorite dish of the night)

2nd course
mine: kumamoto oyster tempura with 3 sauces: japanese salsa, ceviche (it was amazing - green, fresh, lime-intense - my favorite), and thai fish sauce
the bf: raw, kumamoto oysters with the above 3 sauces

3rd course: seared scallops for the both of us (definitely the highlight of the night - I can't stop thinking about this dish!! the scallops were sliced thin and were so delicate and fresh, but it was the sauce that blew us away ... the most perfect sauce that ever was made!!!!)

4th course:
mine: seared sashimi microgreen salad (least favorite dish of the night)
the bf: sashimi microgreen salad

home-made berry/vinegar soda to cleanse our palette ... this is where we learned that dinner was going to be 8 courses! We actually thought it was going to be 5 or 7 ... what a pleasant, belly-bustin' surprise!

5th course: Lobster 'Epice for the both of us - loved it, especially the chive creme fraiche

6th course: melt-in-your-mouth Kobe steak - really, really loved it, especially since I saved some of my lobster to eat with my Kobe ... can we say decadent??

7th course:
mine: the best, darn California rolls that ever existed (chock full of snow crab, avocado, cucumber, and black sesame seeds - Morimoto didn't even have the need to use any mayo)
the bf: nigiri that rivaled the nigiri he had in Japan

8th course: green tea tiramisu - at first, I was a little wary/disappointed because I don't like green tea BUT it didn't taste like green tea at all! It had a white chocolate bottom and a green tea caramel sauce and it was really light and refreshing and COMPLETELY cleansed our mouth - magic!

Drinks: I don't think you can go wrong with any of the cocktails - I ordered the lychee cosmo and it was really good! The bf ordered the Morimoto Rogue beer tasting and loved it.

Overall: We couldn't stop smiling. We smiled while we ate. We smiled while we chewed. We smiled while we swallowed and drank and before, after, and in-between courses. Everything was delicate.

ATMOSPHERE: Um ... this place is really, really cool. I love the hip, artsy, long, narrow, clean white+changing colors design of the restaurant. The ceiling is made of wood and is in the shape of a wave of water. The chairs ... they are the most comfortable restaurant chairs ever.

I usually get slightly anxious when I don't get to select my own food, but turns out anxiety is completely unwarranted at Morimoto. Every single course (of 8) was fantastic! There were many delicious items that were not on the regular menu, whether raw or cooked. We felt the $120 omakase was worth every dollar. 

Besides the ridiculously awesome tasting menus, Morimoto also has an a la carte menu, complemented by a beverage list consisting of signature cocktails, interesting Japanese beers, and various types of wine - though they also have a full bar available. While eating here is not cheap, Morimoto's a la carte prices are no greater than typical fine dining prices in Philly. 

Most recently, I had their duck duck duck dish, which consisted of the most tender and flavorful duck breast with the most amazing sauce, served with a side of duck confit fried rice, topped with a duck egg. The portioning was great: filling, but not overwhelming. It complemented well with my golden pear martini, which is very fruity and delicious. 

The tuna pizza appetizer was also a wonderful mixture of flavors and textures. It tasted so light and fresh. For dessert, I was torn between the black sesame mousse cake and the matcha tres leches. I ended up picking the matcha tres leches. It was very tasty, but once I left the restaurant, I began developing a strong craving for the black sesame mousse cake.

The entrees included the Chirashi which had a nice assortment of fish, although I could have used some more and the sushi rice was perfectly sticky.

I've been to Morimoto in NYC, so I was expecting what to get and how good it would be, as I think it fit into the category, maybe slightly more than what I have expected. 

Compared to NYC one, it was much smaller, as it is only 1 floor (I guess), and it was much quieter. There was awkwardly located light in the middle of table, which made us little bit uncomfortable to share our dishes, but there was no way that we could remove it, so - whatever. 

As an appetizer, we got Toro Tartare and bone marrow spread (day's special) with ikura and shiso leaf pesto. The bone marrow was extremely delicious and the server was very attentive to get us extra baguette ""before"" we asked for - which we loved!

We ordered Uni Carbonara as our noodles dish, and we LOVED IT. Nowadays there are many places that have uni pastas, but this place had one of the best flavored dish - yet it was a little bit salty. 

As an entree, we had Duck Duck Duck, as it was highly recommended by the server. One of my party was a huge duck lover and she told me that their duck dish was better than one of NYC's upscale Michelin rated restaurant. 

We also ordered $60 of Chef's Combination of sushi, sashimi and rolls. It was ""okay"" I guess, but as Morimoto is not like a sushi-ya that only or highly focuses on classical sushi/sashimi, it was okay-leveled. But their tamago was exceptional delicious. Tamago that I've been looking for!

As desserts, because we didn't order too much of food (I GUESS HAHA), Yuzu Merigue Tart (which was too sweet for my guest - but she liked the freshness of yuzu and mango that brought), Matcha Tres Leches was extremely moist and deliciously sweet, and Black Sesame Moussecake, which was loved by all 3 of us and it had such a rich flavor in.

Overall, we loved the dinner as we were pretty much satisfied with most of our dishes and as the server reallyx100 friendly and approaching.

I have been meaning to catch one of these for months, but between kids, work, more work and kids, it just hadn't happened.  Until I caught up with them at Marathon Music Works for the ""Extra Large"" event.  Basically they had some guest chefs in from out of town, so I would say that this was not the standard Otaku South experience.

It couldn't have been a more beautiful day, and we tossed the kids in the car and headed on down to Germantown.  As we walked up around 4:45, they were still setting up the Yakitori grill outside, but good smells were already wafting out.  We asked the ironically mustachioed hipster bouncer how it all worked, and were guided to the ticket table.   For $36, we got tickets for myself, the wife and two kiddos, which isn't that bad, until you remember it is ramen.  

Things got a little zany when we got up to the ordering lines, partially because they had it set up so that you stood in line for the type of bowl you wanted,  Up for that night was:
-Smoked Duck Ramen w pickled duck tongue, cherry blossoms and slow egg
-Vegetarian Mazeman w black sesame, shiso, and salted pickled plum
-Spicy Tantanmen Ramen w chicken broth, sesame chili oil, ground pork and bean sprouts
-Tonkotsu Ramen w pork broth
-Kushiyaki skewers inc. chicken meatball, hanging tenderloin and pork belly

How could I not go for the duck?  I mean, it was right there!  Since the wife and kids are veg heads, they went for that option.  The lines were just a little confusing, just because after you ordered, you kind of had to stand off to the side, which made it seem as if you were standing in another line, and if you weren't assertive, people who ordered later could easily line jump.

Eventually we got it all together, and headed out to a table.  Lighting 100 was playing some great music, and there was plenty of seating.  Grabbed the wife and  a beer after waiting in line for 10 minutes behind some older butch chick who wanted to ask the MMW bartender what every fucking bottle booze was for her partner, who eventually just wanted a PBR.  Le sigh.  Another $10 for oat soda.

Then I dug in, only after noticing my kids had sesame ALL over their faces and were VERY happy - that's a win!  The wife was happy too!  As for mine, it was delicious!  The broth was like drinking confit and the cherry blossoms gave a great flavor.  And the tongues, oh the tongues.  Never had a duck tongue.  Kind of reminded me of a cross between an oyster and escargot with a delicious ducky flavor.  They will forever haunt my dreams.  Great bowl and perfect amount of noodles and WAIT!  No slow egg.  Bastards shorted me.

I couldn't stop there, I had to go back.  Since the previous bowl was from some NYC/Chicago folks, I decided I wanted to go back and try Ms Gavigan's offerings, the spicy ground pork bowl.  Had some trouble getting my bowl because of the line thing, and as I got it, I realized that you could customize it, as they were making them extra spicy for some - dammit, I love spicy.

I tucked in, and it was good!  The only bummer?  There were like a tablespoon of noodles for a ton of broth, and a crapload of sludgy sediment at the bottom of the bowl no matter how much I stirred.  Noodles were gone by bite three, leaving me to drink yummy broth.  Could have definitely used more noodles.  We packed it up after that, a happy and full family, just as it was starting to get crowded.  My only regret was missing the Yakitori offerings.

I would have given this a three star, but the great ambiance, cool venue, and happy family definitely bumped this up a notch.

We had a good - but not ""blown away"" - experience here. Let's talk first about the service: spot on, truly. Our server was a delight; very attentive (though not intrusive), knowledgeable and friendly. Kudos also goes to the bartender that night, as the drinks were FAB: I had the nashi blossom, and highly recommend this as it was ridiculously tasty. My partner had a gin-based drink that was mega strong, so he was very happy with the value! We also did the Morimoto tasting flights of beer - interesting, but a one-time thing just to see if you like any of the house brews. Of all 4, I wasn't so impressed and would really only order the soba ale again as a pint, perhaps. My advice: stick to the cocktails, they're great.

Now, the food. Our strategy was to order a bunch of small things to share, plus some sushi/sashimi/rolls. Here's an overview, in the order it arrived:

1 - Diver scallop ceviche: for me, this was a miss, and not a great way to open the experience. Definitely unlike any ceviche I've had, and not in a good way: the scallop was drowning in some sort of sauce that tasted like a watered-down thousand island dressing. Garnished with popped rice, which was interesting at least. Overall, I would say skip this.

2 - Whitefish carpaccio - HIT HIT HIT. Beautifully presented with an edible orchid garnish, the flavours, texture and colour of this dish were amazing. A bit heavy on the sesame oil, but I like it like that!

3 - Morimoto tempura - perfection, definitely get this. I was skeptical of the gorgonzola dipping sauce, but it ended up being the most delicious of the three. Perfectly crispy tempura coating tender-crisp veggies and juicy shrimp. Yum!

4 - Yose dofu - Interesting and fun, but needs improvement. It is served with a large quantity of a thick crab 'sauce' which is really more like a soup (actually, reminds me very strongly of chinese corn and crab egg-drop soup), so your dofu is swimming in this very milk soup-like sauce but you have NO spoon to enjoy it with. Also the quantity of the soup/sauce is enormous and it feels wasteful. I think this dish should be served with individual bowls and spoons for each diner to place some of the soup in the bottom, and then spoon the dofu over it. Fun for the novelty of being made at your table, but not a must-taste experience at all.

5 - Our selection of sushi/sashimi/rolls: we got the cucumber/shiso/ume roll (veggie), which was AMAZING. I love love love shiso and ume, and this combination with the juicy cucumber is so good. I wanted more!! We also got the otoro, which was fresh but so thinly sliced it seemed sort of stingy. Finally, a selection of seasonal fish served as sushi: greenling (THE BEST, very sweet and snappy, almost like a shrimp), barracuda (pretty good, strong fishy flavour like a mackerel almost, which i love), and grunt (just ok). All were very fresh and the rice was on point.

6 - Uni carbonara - SOOOOOOO GOOD. OMG. Definitely maxed out my sodium levels for the day (or possibly the week) but I don't even care!! Creamy and divine texture, with plenty of uni. Loved this, wanted more. It was like the ultimate version of a mentaiko pasta.

7 - For dessert: black sesame moussecake, and yuzu meringue: outstanding, both of them. The black sesame mousse was so richly flavourful without being too sweet, and the yuzu flavour was the perfect balance of sweet, tart and floral to end on.

Overall, I think that the food here is executed technically very well, but there are just some dishes that either don't work or don't really wow me - and so I can't give it a perfect score. Final verdict: will Morimoto take your tastes to new heights? Not quite. But is it delicious, and a good experience? Yes. You will have a *nice* dinner here.

Sounds nutty from a guy who eats out practically every day at way-too-expensive to hole-in-the-wall joints in NYC, but I truly like the food here b/c it really reflects my 50/50 east/west personality in food form.

I've been here so many times to the point I've met Morimoto on several occasions and even have an autographed menu.  But it's not the star power that makes me like this place.  I really enjoy the fact the food here is tasty, well-balanced, well-priced and strikes that perfect mix of east and west.  

I've tried all versions of the omakase here and all of them have been more than satisfying.  But beyond that there are a couple of entrees that I've made a point of getting in my subsequent visits.  These are the seafood toban yaki and the steak.  The former is just a savory, satisfying seafood stew simmered in a sake based sauce.  The result is pure heaven (for me).  The broth is not overpowering and the quality of the seafood (as you would expect here) is absolutely top notch.  

As for the latter - the steak is honestly my favorite thing to eat.  Why would I love the steak here in favor of NYC icons like Peter Luger?  First off this is not the same kind of steak.  It would not be fair to compare a strip steak here with a porterhouse.  I just personally love the experience and the flavor of this dish, thanks to the perfectly charred and crusted meat, the subtle soy/wasabi dipping sauce that accompanies it.  The flavors blend so well, it almost tastes like you're eating a steak sushi.  It's just divine.  Add to that some tasty veggie tempura on the side and you have that rare, tasty fusion of east and west that so many other restaurants try hard to emulate, but fail in the execution.

The sushi here speaks for itself.  The fish is fresh and the specials are often excellent.  On our last visit, the Kazuo tuna was the featured fish (which really excited me since I don't often come across this type of tuna - usually it's your standard Maguro or Toro).  The texture of the fish was excellent - fresh with a hint of smokiness that gives this tuna its unique personality.  In addition I usually make a point of getting a few rolls - usually the eel, soft shell crab and conventional tuna (just so I can sample the freshness) - and they never disappoint.

I also make a point of ordering the Morimoto sashimi appetizer.  5 straightforward choices (Maguro, Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Crab) with a side of 2 sauces.  Yes it's 25 bucks (which translates into 2.50 per tiny bite) but trust me, it's worth it.  The amazing textures and flavors at play here are worth the cost, which in the greater scheme of things isn't that much.  I can say the same food at inferior restaurants in NYC would often cost more than what you pay here.

As for dessert - I remember they used to have a TON of early issues due to the lack of a decent pastry chef.  In recent years that has changed and their desserts have improved infinitely.  I'm glad to see they have kept standards up - on our last visit we had the red bean/green tea tres leches which was one of the tastiest desserts I've had in a long time.  I also had the black sesame chocolate mousse cake which was excellent.  But the former is definitely a must try at your next visit (assuming it's still there).

All in all I love the place.  After eating there all these years, I""m glad to see they haven't lost a step.  In terms of the overall experience, price, quality and taste of the food, this place will remain my favorite place to eat until something else comes along.",2013-07-09 15:45:32,Morimoto,723 Chestnut St,Philadelphia,PA,39.9496652299,-75.1532727008,"Japanese, American (Traditional), American (New), Restaurants, Sushi Bars, Asian Fusion"

Drinks: Cilantro is a love/hate herb. If you love it like I do, order the Cilantro Gimlet and thank me later. The White Pear is a sweet drink for the ladies and was quite delicious. The Morimoto Hazelnut Ale brewed by Rogue Ales was also  good with a noticeable hazelnut aftertaste. For a really strong drink, go with the Morimoto Martini.

Food: Because it was a celebration, I decided to splurge on the $150pp Omakase. Overall, the food and quality were good but definitely not worth the price of admission.  At that price and for the $120pp price, I would much rather order 2 entrees, 1 cold appetizer and 1 hot appetizer because their regular menu has some delicious sound dishes. 

Now that you know how I feel about the Omakase. I'll give you a play by play of what I ate if you're still interested in trying it.
1) Toro (fatty tuna) Tartare with a light soy sauce and gold flakes
2) Three raw Japanese Oysters, each with a different topping

7) 5 pieces of Nigiri (sushi)
8) Goat Cheese Cake served with Peach Jelly and sprinkled with Black Sesame

We order the dumplings and I got the Morimoto martini. My boyfriend ordered the signature beer flight. You got 5 dumplings in the order and they had a lot of flavor. The dumplings were a little slippery to pick up with chopsticks but i eventually got the hang of it. 

For entrees I ordered the Morimoto surf and turf (medium rare) and my boyfriend ordered the duck, duck, duck (medium rare). We were told the duck was a popular item on the menu. With our entrees our server recommended a white wine to pair with the duck. I was still sipping on my very strong martini so I didn't get a another drink. The wine my boyfriend got was tasty, I ended up stealing a sip. The surf and turf was delicious. A kobe sirloin cooked perfect, Hamachi ribbons on top of avocado salad, and herbed potatoes. I would've never thought to pair raw fish with essentially guacamole but it was good. At first I was reluctant to try the duck, i've had it other places and it was gross. After a few offers I took a small piece and it was not like the duck i've had before. It was tender and had great flavor, also not too fatty. It came with confit fried rice with a duck egg atop. 

For dessert we ordered a black sesame mousse cake. It was a flourless chocolate cake with goma mousse and dark chocolate ganache. It was very rich maybe too rich for one person but we split it.

You won't recognize 75% of what they sell, and the pricetag will be missing, and the label will absolutely not be in English, but they are cheap and good. I will never again buy any spice from Schnucks. (Maybe from the Soulard Spice Market.)

I would like Jays better if they had a more reasonable smell and better frozen food selection, but I'll take what I can get. Oh, and sometimes a girl just wants to buy enough rice for less than 100 meals. (Although I do think they have smaller bags in the back somewhere...)

It was lunchtime on a Sunday & I to eat something I craved!  It seems like every time I go to Santa Barbara which is pretty often, there's one or two new places to eat!   By the looks of the pics on this site from my fellow Yelpers & the great reviews, I thought I found just the place annnnnd, it was brand new! Open for only 2 months.  Of course I hadn't eaten all day and I was starving!  The thing about me is I rather not eat anything at all if I can't eat something that I exactly CRAVE at the moment! And I craved Asian fusion!  Tyger Tyger, according to Yelp looked exactly like my respite & it is right off of the 101 FWY, even better! I was driving up the Central Coast food shopping every Farmers Market & Gourmet store from Hollywood through SB & SLO County for a Thanksgiving gig I'm catering in Big Sur from LA (my first hometown) back to my newest hometown, Cambria, I had to stop in Santa Barbara, my last hometown of 6 years, (also half way home).  I parked in the adjoining lot and saw some happy customers seated outside devouring & sharing their colorful & fresh looking Eats, I couldn't wait to get in the door!  Luckily I made it in between rushes.  I had anticipated ordering the Bahn Mi Sandwich at first- that's what I actually typed in Yelp Search , then according to the rave reviews on Yelp, couldn't decide between the Crispy Rice Salad w/seared albacore & the Weeping Brisket Salad...  I ended up ordering the the Northern Thai Pork Curried Noodle & a Hibiscus Iced Tea.  They serve great local wine & beer on tap too by the way!  The service was friendly & the entire staff was smiling!  The good Energy of this place made me happy and  I sat at the first stool next to the now, busy entrance.  While waiting for my food to arrive I went over to Monkey Shine, a super California & NY/Vegas FOOD (as in Momofuku's Milk Bar, etc.) trend soft-serve Asian ice cream bar (w/vegan options) This is in the opposite corner, all within the same space (room) that also includes a Coffee Roasting facility & a Tea  bar.  Monkey Shine serves flavors like Toasted Rice & Thai Spiced Chocolate, Ginger & Black Sesame, w/several choices of toppings served in a pressed lucky fish  shaped cone &/or Chinese little to-go box.  I tasted the toasted rice & the black sesame, both were delicious  and not at all too sweet, a lot like the stuff they serve at the new super trendy milk cake/""crack pie"" etc., ""Milk,"" on Melrose I had just sampled 2 days before.

Even though we went close to their closing time, a little after 8pm, their boba still tasted fresh. I've been to a lot of places where the boba tastes old and kind of hard close to closing. 

I also thought the price was good for the quality and quantity. I liked that they blended actual black sesame seeds in my drink instead of wimping out with a powder or something. It's one size and my drink was under $5 with no extra charge for boba, unless you want to add an additional topping for 0.50.

stod4rwchlmi5j20DgGZOA,m3_jrBfaxZ2kdKuVrt1jtQ,6_T2xzR74JqGCTPefAD8Tw,4.0,2,0,0,"Started out the evening with a glass of sparkling ume (plum wine). It came in a cute flute and had a drop of actual ume on the bottom. The glass itself was insanely small, but I did manage to get slightly tipsy off it since I downed the whole thing before dinner started. It was happy hour, so it was a little cheaper than expected.

I started my meal with the appetizer-sized soba carbonara, which was quite delicious, though distinctly very non-Japanese. This is to be expected from Morimoto, whose specialty is Japanese-fusion. I really love the flavor and texture of soba noodles, and the sauce really sticks to it quite well. And you definitely can't go wrong with bacon. It could have done without the edamame, and perhaps they should have given me a fork for that dish to help eat them, but I can't complain. The entire bowl costs as much as a single piece of oh-toro.

My sushi selection was basically a dream team of expensive stuff I've been wanting to try for years now. The oh-toro costs twice as much as the others, but it was definitely the best. It's extremely fatty and gives the tuna a cloudy appearance compared to regular maguro. The taste is exquisitely buttery and had to be the best piece of sushi I've ever eaten in my life. The shima aji (striped jackfish) was also extremely good. It's not a fish you will find at most restaurants, but Morimoto claimed on Iron Chef it is one of the best types of fish for sushi, so I had to try it. I wasn't disappointed. The anago, I got on a friend's recommendation. It is sea eel (as opposed to unagi, which is fresh water) and possesses the same fatty characteristics of unagi. It was not as charred as unagi usually is and it lacked a sauce. It makes any comparison difficult to make, but it was tasty. I'm just not sure if I would order it again under the same circumstances. I'd be willing to try it one more time if it were prepared more closely to unagi because I really love that eel sauce. Lastly, the uni, I had to try since so many people hyped it. It was good, but nothing to write home about. It was slightly sweet with a kick of saltiness at the end. It was tasty, but I definitely prefer the taste and texture of raw fish.

For the entrees, I tried some of my cousin's angry chicken. It tasted extremely Indian, and we think the sauce is similar to tandoori. I didn't try the noodles or the giant red chili peppers that my cousin was munching on. I don't think I liked his entree much, but again, it might be better with the rice noodles and the chili peppers.

My entree was wild sea bass with black bean sauce. It was a bit disappointing for me. The black bean sauce was overwhelming on the sea bass. It was way saltier than the stuff I'm used to in Chinese cuisine. By contrast, the sake sauce was extraordinarily light and loaned itself quite well to the delicate flavors of the sea bass. The fish itself wasn't particularly special. I was hoping for some giant lumps of fish fat, but the entire filet was completely lean. What a disappointment. My friend completely cleaned off his plate and even eat up all the sauce with the leftover rice. He really loved it. Personally, I would skip the entrees here and just go for the sushi.

The desserts were both really awesome. My friend's dessert was a delicious sesame mousse cake. The mousse was made from black sesame and was quite silky smooth. Its relatively light flavor contrasted well with the thin layer of chocolate cake on the bottom and the soft chocolate ganache layer on the outside. The presentation of it was also beautiful. I didn't get to try the little cookie on the top, but oh well haha. The dessert I split with my cousin was fantastic. As good as the mousse cake was, the green tea trio (matcha tres leches) was even better. The little cracker on the top was infused with massive amounts of green tea flavor. The ice cream was really light and had the taste of honey. I've never had honey ice cream before, but now I will always crave some. The ice cream contrasted really well with the bit of green tea cake on the bottom. The cake was super moist and had the texture of a piece of bread soaked in way too much syrup. Green tea flavor was bursting out of every single bite. I am guessing that the cake must have been soaked in some kind of strong green tea syrup. It was amazing. 

All-in-all the food was pretty good. The sushi was top-notch and well-sized. The appetizer soba was excellent, though I think next time I go (if I ever go again) I will skip the entrees and either go straight sushi, or get a bigger bowl of noodles. The desserts were a nice finish. My meal cost me ~$90 (w/ tax and tip) even with the discount. I can't say it was worth it, but it was definitely an experience. Go big or go home. I doubt my cousin and my friend enjoyed themselves as much as I did, since they pretty much only had entrees... which to me was the least enjoyable portion of the meal. They said I should have gotten omakase, but meh. Maybe next time.

My friend enjoyed his experience at Morimoto in NYC, so we decided to check out the Philly 'branch.'

My dining experience was just as I have expected.  The restaurant is incredibly chic with minimalistic and modern decor (wavy ceilings with protruded walls and simple tables).  The hosts were welcoming, and our server was attentive.

The food, of course, was incredible!  Started with Shigoku oysters garnished with 3 different 'sauces' (Thai fish sauce, ceviche, and a Japanese-based sauce).  The oysters were meaty and fresh.  I got the lobster ceviche salad; the lobster was done two ways (poached and served ceviche-styled).  Every part of the salad from the seafood to the greens was savory.  Then got the soba carbonara.  While I am not too keen on fusion food, it was delicious.  The flavors all went well together, and it was just easy to eat it very fast because it was so good.  Finally, I got the black sesame (love love love it!) moussecake, and that was divine!

My friend had the dobin mushi (soup with chicken, shrimp, and mushroom), and he said it was great and simple.  Followed by the ""Duck Duck Duck.""  Duck breast, duck egg, and duck fried rice.  Not a big fan of duck, the duck was cooked soooo nicely that I asked for another piece of duck after trying it the first time.

I had the Lotus Blossom (gin, yuzu, and calpico), and my friend tried the Morimoto Soba Ale.  I like my drink, and my friend said his was quite easy to drink.

I only gave this place 4 stars because it is not a place that I can dine often (or even seldom) as it is a pricey place!  But if there is a special occasion and want to eat upscale fine Japanese food in Philly, then this is the place to go.

Their strawberry wasabi with black sesame seeds sprinkled on top were a show stealer - sweet with a hint of spicy!  The raspberry hibiscus was simply divine and fit for a Princess tea party.  They use hibiscus tea and you may just find little flecks within the donut - heavenly!

To accompany the sushi, I had one of the morimoto brand beers. It was ok, I didn't like it that much.

One friend and I had the ""Black & Bleu"" burger, described as:
""Cajun coated and topped with crumbled bleu cheese, lettuce, tomato and
red onion. $9.99."" 

Patrons are given a few choices as a side-dish, soup, salad or ""twigs"" (their code for French fries). I had the sweet potato fries, which were tasty but, perhaps, a little dry. 

Alas, I did not specify how I wanted the burger cooked. So, it was served a teensy overcooked for my taste but, again, I did not order it as medium-rare as I do usually. That's ""My bad.""

Another friend had the ""C.B.L.T.A."", which has the following description:
""It sounds like a government agency but it's actually a delicious sandwich made with
chipotle bacon, lettuce, fresh sliced tomato, chipotle mayonnaise, and sliced avocado
served on classic white bread. $9.49."" 

She had her C.B.L.T.A. served on sourdough bread, enjoyed it very much, and also had a mix of the ""regular"" French fries and sweet potato fries -- one of the side-dish options.

The fourth dish served was from the ""Raw Sushi"" side of the house, a Maki roll, the ""California Roll.""
The description for that: ""Chilean rock crab, avocado, and toasted black sesame seeds. $8.00.""

The place was busy at lunchtime. We had to wait at the bar for a few minutes to get a table. Meanwhile, the waiter took our drink orders and we were quickly seated. The service was friendly and efficient.

Seating is a mix of traditional tables, bar seating and booths at the rear of the restaurant. There is also outdoor seating (too cold outside the day we were there).

Considering that I am Vietnamese I was pretty excited to learn of a new Vietnamese fusion food place. The location is pretty much in the heart of the funk zone. The pink lanterns are definitely an eye catcher. The restaurant was designed kind of the poorly. They were going for the communal feel which I appreciate but the use of space could have been a lot better. You order your food first and then you find a table. The line for the desert was also right in front of a door so that was strange. 

I went with a friend and we got the beef brisket, chicken something noodle soup (I forgot the name) and the chicken wings. It was about $55 for three dishes, which even for Santa Barbara was extremely expensive. The portions were super small as well. 

The beef brisket: the salad that comes with it is amazing! Most of the beef pieces we had were mostly fat and there was very few of it. The sticky rice was good and came in a fun little woven basket. 

The chicken noodle soup dish: I would definitely not recommend. The broth was really bland and the portion was that of a kids meal. It tasted more like a watered down pho and had two small chunks of meat. 

The chicken wings: of all the things we ate I would actually recommend this dish. The sauce was amazing and the chicken wings were large pieces fried to perfection. For the price it was worth it and I would recommend! 

For dessert we tried their ice cream and the black sesame ice cream in the cone was perfect to end the meal. The only problem I had here was the sanitary concern of the cashier handling money and touching tons of things and then using her bare hands to grab my ice cream cone to fill it. 

All in all I think this place will do well but for any Asian native you will probably be disappointed. The price is really High so if you're on a budget I would not recommend unless you can splurge on a meal. I also saw my neighbor order the banh xeo and it was quite comical that the menu said it was meant for 2-4 people to share ONE banh xeo. It also cost $22?!! That is just absurd. In any normal Vietnamese restaurant a single person consumes 2-3 of those alone and they only cost about $8 for multiple banh xeo.

My husband comes home like a town crier with the news. It left me a bit surprised that this nook made it onto the list. Asian Snack is as close to street side dining in China right smack dab inside Saraga. There's a small booth rental with a very small sit down area to eat. Afterwards, you can go treasure hunting in the supermarket full of ethnic finds.

We were lucky to trudge into a big crowd, and it was almost impossible to push a shopping cart in, let alone stand there without being bumped. I'm sure you'd get trampled if you fell over....Then again, I always go there on a weekend and it's packed, literally feeling like a can of sardines. So be brave and fight the Saraga crowd to try this place out.

History lesson 101: Where this ""Asian Cuisine's stall"" specializes in is from this port city in northeastern China (Tianjin), which is very well known for making flaky pastries, scallion pancake pockets, and noodles for their meal instead of rice being their primary staple like in other regions of China and Asia altogether. I could smell the fragrant aroma as I was at the counter looking at the menu.cThe lady at the counter speaks minimal English but they have a picture menu board as well as a menu with English translations. Just point to what you want and she'll write down the order.
 
A man at the opposite corner was making a crispy egg crepe-like pancake (aka Jian Bing Guo Zi) stuffed with fried dough sticks, slathered with spicy sauce, topped with scallions and sesame seeds. I HAD TO TRY THIS AT LEAST ONCE. It's quite entertaining to watch him make it (as I was filming). That Jian Bing was so enormous that we had to take it home to reheat as a snack. I must say, it was crunchy and had a very unique texture and flavor. They also made flaky cake like pastries stuffed with taro, black sesame, or red bean from scratch. We bought a black sesame and red bean filled mini cake and a Chinese hamburger ""Rou ma jio"" to-go. The mini cakes remind me of a ""moon cake"" since it's dense, but it has a wonderful flaky dough. They don't have mutton hamburgers, but the pork as amazingly juicy with the perfect amount of spice. I saw a couple of young college students get a bowl of the beef noodles, which looked spectacular.

It was so, so delicious. I don't know all the ingredients mixed within the Tartare, but I could have had just that and a cocktail and been very happy..

We started with the tofu dumplings for our appetizer. They had great flavor, texture, and the flavor combos worked well. For our main dishes we went with the birria lamb neck quesadilla and the short rib gnocchi. The lamb neck quesadilla was very good. It had a nice rich flavor and was not gamey in the least. The short rib gnocchi were phenomenal. The pickled peppers worked so well with the richness of the short rib. The gnocchi literally melted in our mouth. It was incredible. For dessert I decided to go with the mochi donuts over coconut custard, strawberry yuzu, and five spice caramel. My girlfriend decided to get the black sesame ice cream with pineapple coconut jam, Thai tea caramel, and toasted milk.

I must say there are about a handful of tampa restaurants I can truly say is unique, flavorful and something you would be unable to get anywhere else and rooster and the till fits that bill.

The restaurant itself is very small and intimate with an open kitchen in the middle of the dining area. Thus as soon as you walk in - you will immediately smell all the goodness coming from that kitchen. The menu had both small and large plates but they are all share able and def recommend getting 2 small and 2 larges to split with two people! For the small plates - the scallop crudo stood out over the others. It is raw scallop over a cashew milk gremolata with black sesame and fried chive flowers - amazing ! Another favorite was the schezuan shrimp - head on shrimp with fried oats and green beans. Pasta was also very fresh and delicious!

GGMzYMhrZqw6c3ISWEjoxw,3v_v25pPfO-PRIutqMBtUg,n5i09tgSuzv9ZeIN9Qe5oQ,5.0,3,0,2,"Not sure where to begin: with the five plates we tried, the killer service, or the ambience and beauty of the restaurant. 


1. Food 

For starters, the oysters on special were St. James and Blue Point from the Atlantic northeast. I am already biased toward oysters, but my esteemed dining companion -- and overall favorite person (""FP"") is an admittedly ""inexperienced"" oyster-eater and ate them with me: very high praise. They were prepared with diced green apple, black sesame, and wasabi; we both wished for more of a spicy kick, but they were delicious nonetheless. 

Next we tried the peel and eat shrimp appetizer with hot sauce and lime juice. These shrimp were the largest I had ever seen, and they were prepared simply with a Cajun-ish spice. Says FP, ""They were prepared simply and were not trying to be anything besides what they were."" Agreed! We also got our hands very messy eating these giant sssssseashrimp, which is where I'd like to mention our impressively attentive server, Angel. He commended our peeling skills and brought extra napkins without prompting. 

We continued to get our hands dirty later in the meal, but the next course was the gnocchi with pickled pepperoncini, smoked ricotta, and short ribs. According to Angel, this is a staple on the menu and a must-try for any visit. The RtT gnocchi is not made of potato, but of cloud. (Just kidding.) It is lighter than most gnocchi and in an extremely flavorful sauce. It can be made vegetarian as well. FP says, ""The pickled peppers were pleasantly prepared"" (alliteration mine) ""and the ricotta created a [expletive] deliciously creamy sauce.""

Let's talk about the five-spiced quail now. FP's going to take over because this was his favorite part: the base was like Tom Yum soup, a glorious mix of coconut milk and droplets of some fat (quail? Butter? Don't know, don't care); compressed kohlrabi; lime leaves; and banjo* string chili strands rounded out some perfectly cooked quail wings. They were crispy, spicy, coco nutty. We *may* have drank the broth. 

*mandoline, probably, but banjo actually works better here!

Finally, our last dish was something vegetarian of which I cannot remember the name, but it contained tender and cubed butternut squash, chewy onion pakora, crunchy puffed rice, and creamy tahini yogurt sauce. These textures were varied and complementary, and easily the best of any Indian food or vegetarian food I have ever eaten. FP agrees the texture here was just as important as the flavor, and both were on-point. We are still talking about this dish a day later. We don't know how a vegetarian dish could ever taste better than this. 


2. Service

We had made reservations for a time admittedly a bit early in the night, and were a little late due to rush hour traffic. The hostess was understanding when we called and we had zero issue with our table. Angel, our server, rattled off the beer selections for us with recommendations and tips for our taste. He also helped us choose entrees and starters to share, and seemed to truly care about our experience. No sooner did he clear a plate from our table than someone was taking it from him to wash it. The kitchen staff seemed to be a tight crew and we could see it in the presentation of the food. 


3. Music & Atmosphere

FP brought this up immediately when we were seated: ""This sounds like a playlist that I would make,"" which maybe sounds silly to read but trust me when I say FP crushes it with music so this was a big deal. Anderson Paak, Hieroglyphics, and any other chill indie music you wish you could hear more of on the radio. Is this a ""hipster"" spot? It is hip in the best way, with its reclaimed wood, exposed bulbs and beams, and fresh farm to table food. Rooster & the Till seems to succeed in being trendy while also seeming timeless, which may be more inviting to the non-self proclaimed hipster crowd. 

Sitting at the kitchen bar vs the dining room may be an even more enhanced experience if you want to see more of how the food comes together, but we give it a combined 5/5 and will be returning next time we are in town.",2016-07-02 00:40:52,Rooster & the Till,6500 N Florida Ave,Tampa,FL,28.006845,-82.459706,"Restaurants, American (New)"

He couldn't decide between two items, as usual. I told him we would order both and share. We had the eggplant ravioli and the wheat based gnocchi. I wouldn't have ordered either of my own volition. I would have been so wrong. Both were done in a style that was stunning in presentation and with simply amazing flavors. Not overpowering, but firmly there.

Starting with beverages, my cousin ordered the Thai iced tea and it was pretty watered down. My ginger lemonade was quite tasty though. We decided to split a few dishes; papaya salad, curry pork noodles, chicken street noodles, and the pork banh mi.

Papaya salad and curry noodles came out first, both were tasty but definitely over-salted. Then came the chicken street noodles. I thought that maybe because we had two strong flavors prior to this dish... we weren't able to taste the broth. But that was just benefit of the doubt. It was terribly bland. Even after adding chili and garlic sauce... still couldn't taste a thing. I dipped some of the noodles into the left over curry we had hoping to retrieve some type of flavor but alas... the noodles already absorbed the previous broth and just watered down the taste of the curry. The bread of the banh mi was great, soft and crispy at the same time. Wasn't a fan of the pate, dripped everywhere and was... oily? But it wasn't terrible.

It was kind of strange to see an East Asian inspired restaurant... with no Asian people on the staff or even as customers while we were there. Not saying that other cultures can't draw inspiration and creativity. Food is food, doesn't matter who is creating what as long as it's delicious, right? Given it was opening day... but the food just wasn't consistent and didn't leave enough of an impression for me or my cousin to have the desire to return. Especially regarding how expensive the meal was compared to the portion size we received.

Lastly. We were curious about the soft serve ice cream flavors. We tried the toasted rice, which was actually good. But it was the way the sample was presented to us. The server had gotten ice cream all over her hand. We saw her hesitate to throw it away and make another one. But then she still decided to hand my cousin the sample cup... with ice cream covering and dripping from her entire hand. She then handed me the black sesame flavor I asked for which... when she saw my reaction, said ""it's more like peanut butter."" And she was right.

They started strong. I actually really liked my beverage and the papaya salad. Curry was enjoyable too but was definitely too salty. The rest of the meal wasn't impressive and neither was the the ice cream. But the place was cute, and pretty packed.

Conveniently moved and sharing space with a great Thai spot with a renowned Thai chef who is the proprietor of both establishments, but let's talk about sushi.

This is not typical run of the mill tuna salmon and yellowtail. It's much more than that. Always an interesting selection of more exciting fish, and even more importantly, ALWAYS prepared with a lot of skill. 

Eddie knows his craft and wields his yanagiba with precision. Simple swift cuts, a minimum of movement and 4 motion preparation of his nigiri. Quite a treat to watch and enjoy and savor. 

Also one of the only places where I am comfortable walking in, sitting down at the bar, and saying surprise me...make me some stuff I'll like. And I always do. Always. From a surprise couple slices of torched and oiled salmon belly, to delicately folded fluke...always something special on my plate in addition to the standards. And the standards, again, a step above. Cut properly so there is a delicacy to every bite. You just don't get this in many places. 

Wonderful apps like their spicy tuna rice crisps with black sesame, roasted shallots and micro greens...the delicate usuzukuri Fluke carpaccio with shreds of spicy radish, scallions and citrus soy vinaigrette...and some tasty kitchen treats too!  Can't go wrong with yummy pork belly buns or tasty and savory takoyaki.

- Mango juice with mango chunks and lychee jelly. Perfect for a blistering summer day. (And every day.)

- Snow white juice with green tea ice cream, red bean, and rice balls. Is there a more Asian dessert? Possibly not. Really nice blend of textures - my favorites were the chewy rice balls. By the way, each of these desserts is around $8-9 so by no means cheap but they do fill up the plates to heaping. 

- Also ordered the hot black sesame paste soup with peanut mochi. Brought me immediately back to childhood. Mango mango's version is probably a little less ""authentic"" than other places in Chinatown - it's a lot thicker and sweeter, which is to say, exactly how I like it.

As my dish was the general Tao chicken and waffles I will review that- the waffles are speckled with black sesame which was really excited about but the flavor did not come through enough, the plum glaze on the chicken gave the dish a great overall tang to counter the rich creamy peanut butter (addicting) sauce, I'm not sure where the cowboy candy (jalapeños) were because I didn't have any on my plate but it was mentioned on the menu and I think that heat would have really brought the dish together.

For the entree, we stuck to the popular dishes - the smoked scallops, duck, and the curry vegetables. Smoked scallops was the clear star amongst the three. For dessert, we had the black sesame ice cream and I've been craving it every day since we got back.

Me and the wife ate here, about 8 years or so ago.  We remember enjoying it then, and it's been too long getting back.  Wifey had to bowl Monday evening, so we decided to make lunch of it Monday, June 14th.  We arrived at about 1pm.  It was not crowded and we got a nice window seat overlooking the strip.  I have to say, I had forgotten how cozy the chairs are and how nice the table tops look. Like granite, probably faux, but nice looking.  

Wifey has a new kick and started with a Tom Collins.  I opted for a white Zin.  It's so nice we can order from the sushi bar.  My wife loves cali roll, but only if made with real crab.  Ok, so she's spoiled, lol.  We asked our server and he was honest enough to tell us theirs was not made of the real thing.  In that case, the wifey ordered fried calamari for her starter.

Soon we were greeted by a basket of warm breads, and I do mean breads.  There were several different types in the basket with plenty of creamy butter.  You can be sure we saved most of those for later.  

I had to be greedy and ordered two starters.  I always have to try clam chowder wherever I go, so I ordered a cup of that.  I also ordered my fave sushi, spicy tuna hand roll and salmon skin hand roll.  I think the chowder came first, with oyster crackers on the side. 

Of the whole trip this was the best clam chowder I've had.  The one from the salad bar in the Parrot was watery and skimpy on the clams and potatoes.  The one at Jax in Truckee was good, but a bit heavy on the nutmeg.  Though I thought I ordered a cup, it came in a nice big bowl, see pic.

Then I polished off my spicy tuna hand roll.  Stuffed full of tuna, all the way to the end, I love that.  I hate it when I get a spicy tuna hand roll, and all of the meat is at the top, only rice in the middle, and only a mouthful of nori at the very bottom.  No skimping here.  Nice touch was the real orchid flower on the plate.  See the pics.  I saved the salmon skin for snacking later.  Unfortunately the heat of the tuna roll came from wasabi embeded inside.  Not the usual red pepper and black sesame seed spice I am used to.  Minus a point there.  They did serve both regular soy, and low sodium soy without me having to ask.  Plus a point there.

I munched on some of my wifes fried calamari.  They came in fish stick fashion, not what she is used to, but still very good and tender. I do have a pic of it, I will have to upload it later.  The batter actually stuck to the fish, and the cocktail sauce actually had some bite to it.  No wimpy sauce here.  She loved them.  Better than the Delta Kings.  Her only complaint there were no tentacles.  She loves those, lol.  Take a hint, Sky, fry up some of those wiggly legs, lol.

At last the object of our desire arrived at the table.  The oysters were nestled on the bottom in lovely radicchio cups.  Then piles of fresh crab legs surrounded the tall glass holding the shrimp. On top of legs were a good portion of lobster claws, and the whole thing crowned with jumbo shrimp cocktail.  A set up was presented for each of us along with a large bowl for the shells.  We dug in, cracking and shucking and eating to our hearts content.  

Wifey doesn't do raw food, so the oysters were all mine.  A total of 5 came on the tower of fun.  Each one ice cold and very fresh, and each one seemed like a different species.  

Unfortunately I don't recall our server checking on us once our entree was delivered.  We had to get his attention to ask for more drawn butter and a napkin.  Unfortunately he brought us more wetnaps, when what we really needed was another linen one.  Oh well, we didn't make that clear, not even when he presented the wet ones.  In all, we both got our seafood fix that day, and it was way too much food.  Gladly they brought us a box to take back to our room the two sets of crab legs we just could not finish, and a plastic bag to make carrying it easier.  Good thing I had an excuse for a fridge in our room.

Overall, I like Earth Fare. It's very similar to Whole Foods to me, in price for sure. They have a good selection of bulk foods, grains, nuts, honey, etc and it is easy to stock up on your staple items or just get a tiny amount of something. I appreciate this when I need a small amount of an expensive ingredient, like black sesame seeds. 

The selection of 'aisle' and frozen foods is very good, very good indeed. They have almond flour pasta in the freezer for the Keto folks, and some really good options for all healthy lifestyles. 

My favorite area is the cheese section. The meat section is OK, but the cheese is where they shine. A good selection and the prices are pretty good for the gourmet-ness that you get. I looooooove the olive bar and hope they keep it there forever, because Earth Fare is my first stop when I'm having a cheese party.

It actually turned out pretty good. I decided to get hand rolls since I got no one to share the long rolls with and I'm glad the sushi chef was able to make my favorite rolls in this form (half the size but more meat and less rice). By the way, I came in 45 mins before closing so it's not busy and I feel like I have my own personal sushi chef :) So I started with mussels and miso soup for appetizers. The mussels are good, a bit dry so I suggest putting ponzu sauce for every shell. Then I ordered the GSR hand roll, wow I was blown away!!! The temperature of the fish is perfectly cold, so it tastes fresh. The flavor was amazing, a must try!!! Coz of this I got excited and ordered Rim Special. Wow, I would say getting it in hand roll is the way to go! Lots of meat plus, the mango just sealed the flavor. I like the fact that they keep the mangoes cold too. The combination of this roll was so good coz you would get different layers of flavor and they all end up tasting great and delightfully fresh. I could eat this roll without dipping it to soy sauce. Then I asked for the Buddha hand roll and thought it's just ok. Maybe there's too much sweet sauce in it and the kiwi was just too tart. So I would prefer getting this in long roll. At this point, I wanted to order another rim special hand roll but I wanted to make room for my favorite nigiri, which is the ikura with quail egg. Not disappointed coz I like quail eggs :) needless to mention that I ordered a quail egg shooter which is yummy too. Then I thought I should get one more roll, so I challenged the chef to make a Donald hand roll. I'm surprised that he had to ask me what's in it or maybe he just wanted to make sure. So I told him it got salmon, avocado and lemon. I was kinda unsure of the outcome coz I didn't know the sauce in it or that he might skip the sauce but nope, he knew what's in Donald roll and added the sauce, kani, and black sesame seeds which I missed. Wow that was pretty amazing, now I would only eat Donald in hand rolls. Loved it! At this moment, I got so full and thought to wrap it up. So they gave me my green tea ice cream. While eating, I looked at the time and thought hmmm I still got 5 mins till they close so I asked the chef if he can make a dessert roll and he did! He mixed kani, mango, cream cheese, rolled in soy paper then topped with kiwi and macadamia nuts. It's actually good but I would go for strawberries instead of kiwi then top it with whip cream and chocolate syrup :) 

I would love to give 5 stars but the price is a little higher and thought I could get the same service and quality rolls at a less expensive AYCE sushi in Reno.",2015-03-08 09:19:24,Rim Asian Bistro,2500 E 2nd St,Reno,NV,39.5233694704,-119.7797535136,"Nightlife, Diners, Specialty Food, Chinese, Japanese, Bars, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Sushi Bars, Food"

Of course, this was at that odd time of day when most restaurants are just about finished serving lunch and not yet serving dinner. We wanted to sit, have a drink (too early for happy hour), eat and catch up on non-business chat. We found ourselves at 13th & Chestnut and started walking up the block, suddenly confronted with a lot of prospective places to eat-many with outdoor seating.

Tredici Enoteca has a corner location with a nice brass plaque outside. We had no idea what to expect, other than something probably Italian, and we had reached the too damn hungry to keep walking level of low blood sugar so we headed inside. 

First impression-light, airy, blonde woods, clean, welcoming. It was a hot day and the restaurant has outdoor seating (all full) but they open all their side doors so you still get the feeling of being outside but with reduced noise. Our waiter, Frank, came over to greet us right away and take drink orders. They make an excellent Negroni.

I love seafood so I immediately knew I wanted the raw bar sampler. Henry and I decided on some small plates and when Frank returned with our drinks, we were ready to order. What we had not realized is that Tredici has a sweet lunch deal where you can order 3 items from a list of about 8 to 10 items for $14. Frank pointed that out and told us the lunch items would just be smaller than if they were regular menu items. 3 of the things we wanted were on that list so we chose the bacon wrapped dates, chicken meatballs and the ribs. We got a regular sized order of the broccoli and avocado salad along with the raw bar sampler.

Henry and I both love food and we have very healthy appetites. When we are not dining out, we cook clean food in our homes and make a point to use healthy saturated fats in our diet. This place was avocado heaven for us! As basic as the broccoli avocado dish sounds, it was scrumptious and I was glad we ordered a full size. It was lightly dressed and garnished with black sesame seeds. 

The raw sampler comes with 3 oysters, 3 jumbo shrimp and a small bowl of raw tuna ribbons over more avocado presented on a bed of ice with seafood forks and 2 sauces, cocktail and mignonette. It's a bit pricey at $39 but I could not fault the quality of the seafood.

Henry went nuts over the bacon wrapped dates. 3 come in an order. They are hot and crisp on the outside with a touch of a savory sauce and one bites into a soft, sweet, luscious hot seedless date. We both would have been thrilled with 20 more of these. 

The meatballs were fine, nothing remarkable and the ribs were tender with meat falling off the bone. The sauce was not the usual sweet barbecue stuff; it was more savoury and subtle. I let Henry have the bulk of these as ribs are not one of my favorite foods. 

We ordered a second round of drinks and service throughout the meal was superb. Efficient, friendly and well timed. The place is noisy but still allows non-screamed conversation between table mates. We were not rushed and when we finally paid our check, we were both chuffed as hell with having found a great new place for that weird not lunch/not happy hour/not dinner time of day.

Though it seems like an oxymoron this buffet does has some good HOMEMADE food that is worth a taste.

  First the salad bar is very green and yada yada, but let's be real your not paying $10-15 a person to eat salad.  

**1st plate (as pictured) 
Ham- salty and pretty dry 
Garlic Bread- Cold, wet, and hard edges
Sour cream potatoes- Top was rubbery and overcooked, tasted of heavy sourcream
Mashed pot- Real redskin mashed made fresh AWESOME! 
Mac n cheese- Must use KFC'S left overs, have that same pasty liquid cheese from a bag, soo bland
Fried Chicken- Juicy, crunchy, and tasted better than KFC. it's meh at its finest

2nd plate

BBQ chicken- Light bbq sauce glaze, flavorful, tender, sauce builds with spice and sweetness. Great
Rotisserie Chick- Slow roasted, juicy, crispy skin well flavored, Great 
Grilled cod- Seasoned well with paprika and black sesame seeds, overcooked and super dry.  
Beef Stroganoff- Salty beef sauce, with very tough cuts of beef, super bland. 

3rd Plate (Super Flavor Plate) If you don't want to play games get these items! 

Roll w cinnamon butter- fresh baked, light, airy, hot and taste amazing with the creamy butter. 
Mash- Once again fresh homade REAL potatoes 
Turkey Breast- fresh cooked, lean, succulent, turkey Breast carved right in front of you. 
Rotisserie Chick- All about slow roasted flavor
Kettle Roasted Turkey- Truly a signature dish filled with flavor and hearty pieces of carrots and potatoes.
Ham- Depending on if they are cutting it hot, this is really hit and miss. I like the roast beef but tends to have lots of gristle. (Fat) 

Desserts- I tried the best looking ones 
Oreo Cake! - Light sponge, Oreo crunch, chocolate and all around a winner. 
Brownie Lava-  This was hot, chocolatey, and a bit overcooked. 
Rice pudding- It was bland with no taste 
bread pudding- Meh 
Cookie- Hard and burnt, look out for the lemon icing cookies they are the best.  
triple berry cream cheese cake- This had a light frosting, dense sponge, and not much flavor.

Hearing good things about Wokworks, we decided to hop on DiningIn and see what all the fuss was about.

Spicy Asian Pickles [$1.95]
Pickles, chili 

We started off with the spicy pickles. While a pittance of a portion, they were crisp and sweet, with spice that came through on the finish.

Jalapeno Brussels Sprouts [$4]
Brussels sprouts, gluten-free soy, jalapeno

I'm a brussels sprouts fiend so naturally, we had to order these. While I missed the touted heat from the jalapenos, the sprouts had nice bite and were well seasoned. Thankfully, they weren't overly salty from the soy.

Crispy Edamame Dumplings [$4.95]
Peanut sauce

The edamame dumplings were nice - incredibly crispy with a creamy essence within. They were topped with some green onions and sweet black sesame seeds.

BBQ Pork Belly Sliders [$5.95]
Steamed buns, pork belly, pineapple salsa, cilantro

Regular readers know that the pork belly buns were a must order for me. The gluttonous pork was well-braised and had a lightly sweet glaze. The dish itself could have used more texture, with the soft, pliant buns rendering each bite soft on soft. I could have used more pork as well - perhaps double pork a la Momofuku? Still, the accompanying pineapple salsa and cilantro brought some bright balance to the heft of the pork.

Build Your Own Tall Wok [$10.95]
Lo mein, chicken, snow peas, mushrooms, bok choy, crispy shallots, roasted almonds, Blackgold teriyaki sauce 

But what is Wokworks really known for? Their stir-fried noodles! We elected to build our own, with chicken, lo mein noodles, and a melange of various veggies.
These noodles weren't mushy at all and thankfully had life to each bite. They were well-coated with the requested Blackgold teriyaki sauce and the multitude of accompanying additions helped to create a hearty dish.

Overall, Wokworks delivered an experience that was well above the standard Chinese takeout you might order on a random night. Do try their stir-fried noodles.

The waiter then took our menus without us ordering entrees at the time which seemed strange, but we figured he would come back to take our entree orders.  The appetizers came out and the bacon wrapped shrimp was okay and the calamari was sub-par in that it was not crunchy and somewhat rubbery, but still edible. If this in itself were the only issue we could easily have gotten over it.  Once we finished the appetizers the waiter asked if we were ready for dessert.  We explained we wanted to order entrees and he apologized and said he misunderstood and thought we were just ordering apps.  No big deal. 

I ordered a bone in strip steak and my girlfriend ordered the black sesame tuna.  I had ordered my steak medium, which they said would have a pink middle, which is what i wanted.  When i cut into the steak it was completely raw in what i would describe as tartare at best. It barely had a seer on the outside. On top of that the one bite I did take had zero seasoning and literally just tasted like they took the piece of meat and put it straight on the grill.  No salt, no pepper, not even a true seer on the outside to provide the crunchy texture one would expect from a steak.  My girlfriend's tuna she immediately said tasted ""off"" after her first bite.  I tried it and it did have a strange almost sour off putting taste.  Im not sure if it was the fish itself or the seasoning, but it was not pleasant. 

The manager came over and asked us how our meal was and we explained to him the above.  He apologized and asked us if we wanted new entrees brought out.  We said no as we had both lost our appetite at that point and he said he would ""take care of it"", which was fine.  He then brought back the bill and offered us free dessert which was nice, but at that point we really just wanted to leave.  

In looking at the bill when he ""took care of it"" he discounted each entree less than half of the purchase price!  I had a gift card that covered the entire cost of the meal so I did not complain further, but he did not know that at the time and the reality is the full entree cost should have been removed as neither of us actually ate the entree and immediately brought our concerns to the attention of the manager. 

The final dagger was that after we got our bill neither the manager nor our waiter would come back over to run the gift card or my credit card so i could leave a tip.  (Despite the terrible food i know that this was not the fault of the server).  Unfortunately we literally sat for over 20 minutes before we could finally flag down another waiter who ended up running the cards for us.

My companions and I stumbled upon TSUJIRI and we decided to make a pit stop for some matcha goodness.

There were street parking but they were all taken and metered so we decided to park across the street at Save On Foods (we shopped there first to make our parking legit).

The inside of the restaurant was very zen; peaceful and serene.  (It was a Sunday afternoon but the shop wasn't busy)  Since it was a rainy day,  I quickly decided on a hot beverage.  I ordered the black sesame matcha latte and it was indeed satisfying.  Not a whole lot of black sesame taste but the matcha was intense.

We were happily surprised, and enjoyed their offering of coconut ice cream and fried bananas. The bananas were fried light and crispy and the coconut ice cream was creamy and delicious. They adorned the desert with a drizzle of honey and black sesame seeds. My only small critique on this is the amount of fried bananas is small in comparison to the amount of ice cream they provide.

- Sticky toffee pudding: their specialty was just ok for me. 3 stars

Lowlights:
- Cold: vibe didn't feel welcoming and was actually temperature actually matched being cold in there as well. So many places in Nola are full of life that this seemed out of place and almost too formal for a casual gastropub setting.

I have the pleasure of working right across the street from Fabrica, and I can confidently say that after one visit, that this is going to get me into trouble!

I am usually a plane Jane when it comes to my pizzas, and am very picky.  So I decided to venture off and get the Favorita pizza.  This included:  mozzarella, provolone, chicken scallions and drizzled with red pepper sriracha sauce and black sesame seeds.  O-M-G.  I was in heaven.  Someone else ordered the Funghi pizza which is mozzarella, provolone, sweet and sour onions, oven roasted mushrooms and rosemary.  I am not a mushroom fan, but she was a huge fan of it and it looked mighty pretty!  Two others ordered the Vendura which is broccolini, whipped ricotta, mozzarella, garlic chili flakes, EVOO and baby spinach.  I kept eyeballing it the entire time as well!  The pizzas are presented very well and the ingredients are very good quality.  For a personal pizza, the prices vary from 13-17, so it can be on the pricey end depending on what you get.

The interior is very trendy with a bunch of aesthetic decorations, including the famous pink lanterns that line the ceiling and help cultivate the super cute vibe inside.

Opted for ice cream in a taiyaki fish cone. Keep in mind that these cones are significantly smaller than the ones that are often seen in popular chains throughout LA/socal. Couldn't tell if the worker who was swirling my ice cream was being stingy but my ice cream came out looking very sad and lopsided. Paid an additional 50 cents for fruity pebbles on top. In photo attached you can see that my hand is way bigger than the cone itself and that the serving of ice cream is quite small as well. Overall the presentation was quite disappointing and looked very different from the photos advertised online. 

In terms of the actual taste..
Taiyaki fish cones: I saw that there were multiple already premade and on display, you could tell that it wasn't fresh and had been sitting out for a while. The best part of taiyaki cones is the contrasting crunchy exterior to the soft inside breading after it is first made, it could have been a lot better if their cones were made-to-order. The bread was, as expected, hard from having been set out for a while and also was quite bland, there was nothing memorable about it. 

Ice cream: They had four flavors available, chocolate, vanilla, black sesame, and mango sticky rice. Opted for the latter two in hopes of finally having some type of Asian-inspired dessert in this city which has very mediocre Asian cuisine overall. First of all, the cone was so small that there was very little ice cream that came with it. Black sesame did not have that mellow nutty flavor and strangely tasted more sour and lemon-y. The mango sticky rice did not taste even remotely of mango and had a very potent aftertaste that I could not get off my tongue. To be honest I didn't want to be too critical given that it is probably impossible to measure up to actual Asian ice cream shops back in the bay or LA but it's hard to describe what exactly they tasted like - I just know for sure that they did NOT taste anything like what I was expecting. 

For a place to specifically pride itself in serving Asian ingredients and spices in their ice cream, this place was really far off the mark. I really wanted to like it but both flavors were extremely disappointing - neither of them tasted anything like what they were labeled and I honestly have to question if it is because the establishment is run by people who do not have an in-depth understanding of Asian flavors. Disappointed, but I shouldn't be surprised given that this is Santa Barbara. Considering the price point for what you get, including paying an additional 50 cents for each topping, I have to give this place a solid no. Overall, I encourage you all to save your money or spend a little more and go to McConnell's instead for some actual high quality ice cream.",2019-03-10 01:26:27,Monkeyshine,121 E Yanonali St,Santa Barbara,CA,34.4158054,-119.689906,"Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Food"

There are things about this place that could be really good, If they just tweaked it a bit.

What we had: Koran corn dog, soup dumpling, hamachi, Wagyu nigiri, Chilean sea bass, short ribs, black sesame ice cream, cheese cake. (Total $170 before tip)

There were no real stand outs here, not for the pricing. If we're being real, pay a little more and go to Hinata. That's worth the money. 

Anyway, the worst part of the meal was the sushi rice. How can it be mushy and hard at the same time? How can you open a higher end restaurant that serves sushi and then not try to attempt to make good sushi rice? Here's some advice to the chef, take a trip to Asaka or even one world market, and taste their rice's flavor and texture... then try to replicate it. If they did that, then they would have something good going on, because the sushi flavors are there, the rice just ruins it all.

The soup dumpling doesn't really have soup in it. So that was unfortunate. The flavor was on point, but I don't think they have enough congealed liquid to meat ratio for it to be really soupy, and their skin is too thick. 

I can't speak to the Chilean sea bass, as that was more my husbands deal, it was cooked fine, but the charred (korean bbq-esque flavor) was a bit odd putting. 

My short ribs were good, I though it was cooked nicely. If I were them, I'd do a pickled daikon or maybe a chayote, instead of a red radish, but the slices of Asian pear were a good accompaniment.

The deserts were alright, our favorite was the black sesame.

Mochi donuts were originated from from Japan and is one of the star product at Mister Donut in Taiwan. It was super popular since about at least 10 years ago in Taiwan. I never seen these being sold here in the US until recent years. It's becoming a new hit in cities with more Asian populations. I am so super excited that we can finally get them here in St. Louis! 

If you never tried, they are a hybrid of cake donuts and mochi, with a dense and chewy texture. Usually a sugar/flavored glazed will be applied on one side of it. This week, they have Strawberry and Black Sesame and I love them both!!! Not quite as chewy as I would hope but it definitely meets my standard and every bite is so joyful

They have had Matcha, Taro, Cookies and Cream and powdered sugar flavors before. I think only the Delmar and Kirkwood locations have it right now.

Bao bun 5/5 - the slaw is a perfect balance to the softness of the bun. The grilled pork had a great smoky taste. Oof yes loved it.

Hamachi Sushi 4.5/5 - the garlic chili crunch really came out in this one, and it balanced surprisingly well with the asian pear slivers. I could definitely have a bottle of the garlic chili crunch. Only complaint was the sushi rice, a little too hard in parts.

Edamame 4/5 - simple and tasty with a kick from that garlic chili sauce. The spice from the garlic chili sauce was a little overwhelming at times making it hard to distinguish the soy sauce and lime. Did we finish it all though? Absolutely. 

Tikka masala 4/5 - so creamy but with a great balance of lightness, especially with the cauliflower. It could use a slight twist of freshness. The dish is also vegan and gluten free!

Tamarind noodles 4.5/5 - hefty serving of jumbo shrimp just slightly overcooked. The bean sprouts offer so much textural contrast, and there's a little spice but isn't overwhelming.

Center cut sirloin 2.5/5 - most of this fell flat, the broccolini was super dry, the sirloin was also tough to cut into. The mash potatoes flavor was great but the texture could have been creamier. 

Mango sorbet with plantains 4/5 - loved the sorbet, loved the plantains, didn't love them together. One of my plantains was a little hard but the rest were fantastic with the dulce de leche. The sorbet was great with coconut flakes. 

Sesame icecream with chocolate mint ganache 3.5/5 - I didn't love this pairing, couldn't put my finger on what exactly wasn't working here. Black sesame was overpowered by the chocolate mint. 

Ambiance 8/10 - the music was a little too hype for the rest of the place and it was quite loud. It's VERY chilly so bring a jacket if you get cold easily. Signal is spotty but they have wifi.

Dave, whom I think might be the owner, responded promptly. For my first visit, it was just a friend and I. This restaurant seems to have once been a home and has since be converted. So, be mindful when parking, it's street parking and there are houses nearby. 

There is a painted sign out front and there is a sphere water fountain in front of the stairs. When stepping onto the porch there are two entrances; a door to your left and a door if you keep walking straight. I think it is seat yourself, because I've never seen anyone waiting at the door to seat people and I've seen other customers just walk in and seat themselves. Both times I've made reservations they have a little paper placeholder with your name and reservation time on it. I like that they use both sides of it; they seem environmentally conscious. They don't automatically put straws (or lemons) in your complimentary glass of water and their take-out containers are recyclable, if not biodegradable. I would describe Bellefonte Cafe's style as eclectic. I like that none of the tables, chairs match, and it is boldy colored with complementary artwork.

My 1st visit: As we were sitting down, I told the waiter I was communicating with someone running their facebook and asked to speak with them. Dave, the owner (I think), came over to our table to introduce himself. I like face-to-face communication after corresponding online in a situation like that; good owners care about their customers. He was nice to give me a complimentary dessert for my birthday. 

The waiter seemed to be, I don't know if distracted was the word to describe it, but something was off. One thing I wasn't a fan of was that he never came to ask how things were. They weren't that busy either so I don't know if there was something happening behind the scenes.  He was prompt with refilling our water glasses though. 

I ordered their Thai Chicken Salad (slided chicken breast, orange lime ginger sauce, black sesame seeds, scallions, seasonal greens, grape tomato, cucumber.) The greens and other veggies were super fresh. But the chicken was dry and the sauce was overpoweringly tangy. Also, I didn't taste any ginger. I think maybe that would have balanced out the sauce a little more.

My 2nd visit today was much better. Our waiter was a curly haired bearded guy named Dave. My mom and I weren't really interested in any of their apps so we shared an order of their Hummus Stuffed Avocado (half avocado stuffed with homemade hummus, topped with grape tomato, red onion, Kalamata olives, extra virgin olive oil, chopped herbs, served with crostinis.) It was really good. Their hummus was delicious! Also, the Kalamata olives were the best I've ever had. The ingredients go really well together, and I think it's perfect portion for two.

For my entree I ordered their Pine Nut Salad (roasted pine nuts, blue cheese, scallions, seasonal greens, grape tomatoes, cucumber, honey mustard vinaigrette) with chicken for an extra $2. Again, their veggies were very fresh. Their tomatoes and cucumber were my favorites. I asked for my dressing on the side. Dave dropped off our food and a waitress came over with the dressing a couple secs later. I tasted it and my mom tasted it and it tasted like regular vinaigrette. When we saw Dave, I asked about the honey mustard vinaigrette that was supposed to be with the salad. He went and got it but I don't know if there was confusion happening or what, but he said it was the same one that the waitress brought. But the one he brought, you could taste the honey mustard, with the other one, you could taste the vinegar. Regardless, they were both yummy. I just wanted to make sure I tasted both of them.

Also, they seem to have a musician every night around like 6:30ish. It's a fun atmosphere with good food. I'm sure I will be back and am looking forward to trying other things.

Here's the run down:

We shared a few small plates, three of which were on the regular menu and one special for the night.  The special was beef bone marrow with roasted poblano peppers and parmasean cheese with onion pancakes.  I don't think you can ever go wrong ordering bone marrow... it's the best butter substitute ever!  The onion pancakes were nice and dense.  We also got the shrimp and green papaya salad, the okonomiyaki fries and the kimchi katsu don bowl.  The standout were the fries... those bonito flakes were a fun and delicious treat.  We liked the kimchi bowl the least.  The pork was too fried and I felt like the kimchi wasn't spicy enough... although it had great acidity.  

We also shared a small bowl of the house ramen.  No added shennanigans.  The broth was ok... needed more seasoning I felt.  We kept adding the spice and black sesame salt that they have on the side as condiments.  The noodles were well done, so that's a plus.

For dessert, we had the chocolate pecan chocolate pie.  That was scrumptious!  It was chewy and had the right balance of everything.  Although, at $6.50, we thought it was overpriced for a slice of pie.

I had heard good things about this restaurant, but it exceeded my expectations.  We got the chef's tasting menu for 5 people and thoroughly enjoyed it. There are two options: pick your own dishes (roughly one from each section of the menu) or just let the chef choose. We did the former - pick our own - but the waitress helped guide us towards some of her favorite and/or most popular dishes. After that delicious dish after delicious dish came out as they were ready. (The 6th guest was gluten free and the waitress helped her select allergy-friendly items separately that she said she enjoyed).

We ended up with:
Yellowtail sashimi - everyone loved this - the flavors were great and fish so tender
Tuna with avocado - also a big hit and great quality fish and sauce very tasty
Japanese fried chicken - I think the restaurant is known for this - it was very good
Edamame dumpling - also one of the most popular dishes. Some thought this was a standout, others thought good, but not as thrilled
Salmon sushi roll - great quality, but less exciting than some other dishes
Octopus robatayaki - deliciously tender and well-seasoned
Rib-eye robatayaki - this was absolutely fantastic. You wouldn't think you could make a piece of rib-eye on a stick that much of a standout, but this dish melted in my mouth
Beef short rib - good sauce and flavor, but the robatayaki was better
Broiled sea bass - delicious, melts in your mouth - definitely a favorite
Crispy brussel sprouts - also got high marks from the table
Dessert: black sesame ""cheesecake"" tart - everyone seemed to like it and it had nice flavor, but the savory items definitely outshined the dessert

Overall, I think we all agreed there wasn't a bad dish. They were all great, with some standing out more than others, but really exceptional start to finish. We were also all impressed with the portion size.  For $55 they really give you your money's worth and portion out the items well.  We ended up taking home a few leftovers because we simply couldn't eat it all and were very full by the end.  Though, at the same time everyone did sample everything so it wasn't completely overwhelming. The chef's tasting was nice because everything came out such that we could split it equally and you get enough items that you're still feeling like you get to taste a lot of dishes.  I could see ordering a la carte being fun too, though, if everyone picks a few dishes they are excited about - not sure how it would price out if you did it that way. The cocktail menu also has a number of exciting options and we all enjoyed sampling with some advice from the waitress. 

The ambience of the restaurant is also very cool.  The top floor is more of a bar/lounge area, whereas the downstairs (where we ate) is setup like a speakeasy with a separate unmarked door and very cool vibe. We were also seated at probably the best table in the restaurant, a plush circle booth that is a few steps up from the main dining floor and overlooks the whole restaurant. It was more private and special (and comfortable) for our group, but we still got to enjoy the ambience of the downstairs restaurant.  Just lucked into this table, but would definitely request if possible in the future with an appropriate size group. Though the other tables I'm sure are fine and the food is the worth sitting at any table.

From specialty sashimi, the salmon with spicy ponzu and soy ginger. The salmon was nice, but the ponzu completely overpowered the fish.


From cold, the ceviche with kampachi, mango, and yuzu kosho ponzu. Also not my favorite, something about the flavors didn't sit right with me. It was pretty zingy.


From sushi/sashimi, the toro nigiri. It was really good toro and melted in my mouth.


From crispy, the shrimp taco with radish, chili, and avocado. The shrimp could've been crispier, but I really liked the creamy avocado at the bottom, and the flavors all balanced nicely.


From small, the edamame dumplings. This dish was my favorite of the evening. Edamame dumplings don't sound like much but these were creamy and delicious, and the accompanying broth tasted a lot like shiitake mushrooms.


From the robatayaki, the octopus and the rib eye scallion. The octopus was a bit overcooked and had too much sauce. The rib eye scallion was juicy, but I felt like the scallions could have had so much more flavor. I'm not sure how they managed to make scallions so tasteless, but they succeeded.


From the fish, the broiled seabass with truffle soy and pea shoots. I was pleasantly surprised by this dish, since the fish was very flaky but fatty enough to maintain its juiciness. My only complaint was that it was on the salty side.


From the sides, the black cod fried rice with miso caramel. The rice itself was prepared well, but I'm not a huge fan of sweeter dishes. Miso has a great depth of flavor, and I felt like this dish was missing some of that.


For ice cream mochi I got orange creamsicle, Belgian chocolate, and vanilla chocolate chip. They weren't anything special, and at this point I just sat there thinking really? After giving me all the least adventurous dishes you could've picked, these are the flavors you give me. I was expecting flavors much more interesting than this (like black sesame perhaps?).


That was all I got. At this point, you might be thinking, but wait. You said there were 10 selections + mochi, I only see 9 selections + mochi. Where in the world is the tenth dish? Trust me, I was wondering the same thing. Apparently because I was a solo diner, I only got 9 selections. This fact was not made apparent to me at the start of my meal, and as a result, I was pretty annoyed when I found out I would only get 9 dishes at the same price of 10. In case any of you decide to go solo at the restaurant, just keep this in mind.


All in all, this meal was incredibly ordinary. None of the dishes besides the edamame dumplings stood out to me. The chef's choices of dishes were also really boring.

Having never had shaved ice cream or rolled ice cream before, I didn't know what to expect. We ordered the pink cosmos and matcha rolled icecream with unlimited toppings (given the small size of the cup, there really is a limit to the number of toppings you can put on. I keep imagining myself dousing the rolls with mountains of mochi and fruit pieces, but the workers are much more conservative with their serving sizes). 

BTW.. the pink spoons turn blue/purple when exposed to cold! That was really neat. 

[Food] 
I was really looking forward to seeing them shave a huge block of ice in persion, but a cup of pink appeared out of nowhere. I decided that they may have already pre-shaved and then had it in the freezer for convenience.  The texture was heavenly.. melt off the tongue... very cotton candy like. However, there was something very artificial tasting, almost medicinal, about the pink cosmos. I could not decide whether it was the ice cream base or the syrup. I would probably try the cheesecake or black sesame flavor next time

The person who made our rolled icecream was quite skilled. He produced 5 perfect rolls which were coated with our choice of toppings.The matcha rolled icecream stole the show with it's very heavy and distinctive flavor. There was a little bitterness to balance the sweetness, making the dessert quite delectable. The mochi and red beans were the perfect toppings. Unfortunately, the spoons were not quite strong enough to break through the rolls  - you definitely needed to work at it. That being said, the presentation, performance, and taste was worth 5 stars.

There were six of us and we made our lunch reservation a little over a week in advance.  However, it was already slim pickings for time slots since we were visiting over a very popular weekend.  Luckily, you have the option to try for outdoor seating the day of.  You can call Shaya at 10am when they first open to make a same-day patio reservation, but we instead just showed up at the restaurant when we wanted to eat and were very lucky they had a patio table available for 6 immediately.

Aside from being able to eat our lunch at a normal hour, eating outside was even more of a blessing because the A/C inside the restaurant was FREEZING.  While I am sure that wood-burning oven makes the staff toasty warm, I am just as sure the indoor guests were most uncomfortable.  Other reviews even mentioned teeth chattering!

Once we were seated in the lovely and comfortable patio area, our epic meal began.  The service was quick and friendly.  The drinks were tasty.  The food was amazing.  The portions are pretty small, as you might expect, so order a bunch of things to share, and maybe some duplicate dishes too to make sure there is enough for everyone.  I wouldn't come here planning to stick to a modest budget.  This is the perfect restaurant to go nuts and end a nice vacation with a bang.

They brought out only one or two fluffy pitas at a time for our table of six to share.  We tore into each pita like animals, scalding our hands in the process every. single. time.  Meanwhile, the table beside us used a fork and knife to cut up their pita, like civilized people.  

I'm pretty sure we enjoyed our meal more.

Normally when a restaurant offers me a dessert menu I take a hard pass.  In this case, I *demanded* to see the dessert menu and, though we had eaten plenty already, ordered three dessert items.

Will has fixed tasting menu every Sundays and ala carte on the rest of the days. 
Overall, we had really fantastic experience dining at Will. The nuances were romantic and fitting dim lighting, service was attentive but not overbearing. Good space between the tables. 

Okay, here is the most important part : foods were awesome. We had the entire tasting menu with additional rabbit terrine+ foei gras with pistachio tuile/blood orange. It was worth the money. 

Appetizer : 
Sweet Potato+ Apple Potage - Banyuls | Pecans & Pumpernickel | Asian Pears --amazing!! I should say this was my favorite part.
White Miso Cavatelli - Black Olive| Mussels | Piperade - really enjoyed the piperade with enough hints of the mussels.
Duck Confit Royale - Lentils Du Puy | Potato Mousseline | Alliums -- A little too heavy but great taste.

Entree :
Rhode Island Skate Wing with Fennel Moutarde | Yuzu | Chickpea Panisse --beautifully well balanced entree, pretty dish too! 
72 Hour Beef Rib Steak with Parsnip Creme | Glazed Salsify | Pumpkin -- very soft and tender, nicely cooked to rare medium - servers didn't ask our preferences but it worked just fine for us.

Dessert :
Almond Financier with Pineapple | Black Sesame Buttercream | Roasted Banana -- Not too sweet! which suits me, love the dessert especially the black sesame buttercream.
Bergamot Creme Brulee with Szechuan Biscuit -- the creme brulee has very lemony taste. I didn't care that much for the szechuan biscuit.

We arrived at Bubble House with the kind of appetite where anything you stuff in your mouth is going to taste gourmet. Additionally, we were on vacation and in love, so maybe my review is biased, but I loved the place.

The wife and I split a veggie hoagie and salad, which were both great but not especially memorable. I have a real fondness for spicy potatoes, and predictably loved the wasabi mashed potatoes. The sweet potato fries and the orange ginger dipping sauce were the real winners, though. If I lived nearby, I could see myself swinging by for bubble tea and fries pretty regularly.

We ordered the traditional Shanghai dishes to see if Edmonton has finally found it's very own truly authentic Shanghai eats.  Nope.  While I must admit the drunken chicken was a tasty appetizer, the rest of the meal was quite oily and pedestrian.  You may expect the same quality from any ""pick 3 combo"" Chinese take away from a mall.  
The xiao long bao WERE quite nice the first time we went, but subsequent visits when we went with other friends were met with poorer and poorer quality of food.
During our last visit, the ""XLB"" ,as they liked to coin it in the Edmonton Journal (I would regard this as a marketing ""branding"" scheme on behalf of the owner's Journal advertisement), were not freshly steamed, cold, and quite possibly microwaved? The wrapper lacked it's much desired chewy/stretchiness and the signature ""jus"" from a xiao long bao was missing.  
For dessert, we ordered the ""tong yuan"", which is akin to a Japanese mochi.  Tong yuan, if you wiki it, are glutinous rice dumplings, inour case, filled with black sesame paste in a sweet soup.  They should be delectably chewy and a burst of intense flavour when the filling erupts from your bite.  Our tong yuan however...
Well first, there were bits of carrot, mushrooms, and napa cabbage in our tong yuan's sweet soup (we had earlier ordered a savoury soup as part of our meal which had these peculiarly same ingredients).  When inquired about this, our server merely said, and I paraphrase but do not exaggerate, ""well we reheat the sweet soup in our woks, so maybe some of other bits of food found its way in"", as if everything was perfectly normal and that we were silly in thinking otherwise.  Next, the soup was speckled with bits of black sesame paste that broke out of our tong yuan.  Then the tong yuan itself. They were overboiled, sludgy, not chewy at all.  Some because of premature eruptions, were empty of their black sesame innards.  As one who buys and eats tong yuan from the frozen section of T&T, it is easy to see and taste that Shanghai Grill's tong yuan were not homemade (as they sheepishly try to deny) but bought out.  In addition, they couldn't even reheat and prepare them properly in accord to the manufacturer's instructions.

Why don't I just toss it up as rubbish and move on with my day? Mainly because I only had $10 in cash at the NoLibs 2nd Street Fair to spend on food and $6 of that $10 was, basically, wasted leaving me feeling unsatisfied.

I thought that the Dan Dan Noodles sounded really good because I adore those noodles at Han Dynasty. Well, not all Dan Dan Noodles are created equal. DumpnRoll's version was made with Raman Noodles (the packaged kind you get for 50 cents with the flavor packet- and they could have benefited, greatly from the flavor packet). Do you know those tiny, foil packets are like silver dollars in jail? Learned that from OITNB. Anyway, the Raman were topped with shredded carrot, mini cucumber batons, slivered scallions, black sesame seeds and served with a small container of mildly spicy peanut sauce. I asked for hot sauce, but they did not have any which dumbfounded me as Asian food is always offered with Sriracha or chili oil.

The Raman Noodles were cooked to, almost, mush. The veggies atop were fresh & crisp. The sauce, although it offered some heat, was extraordinarily bland and not quite enough for all the noodles. I thought that the amount of sauce was the cause of its tastelessness, so I returned to the truck, now ravenous, and requested another container of sauce which I enthusiastically emptied onto the noodles.

I was so voracious, I ate half of them, flavorless, in all their squishy splendor.

I'm not a sushi snob; it doesn't matter to me how ""Western"" or ""Eastern"" or authentic my sushi is, so long as the fish is fresh and it tastes good. But I am rather picky about what goes into my food, and for some reason those mentioned ingredients just didn't sound appetizing as part of my sushi. That being said, it took me a while to work up the guts to try this place out.

I went on a Saturday afternoon/early evening with my boyfriend. We wanted to make sure that we were there for the dinner menu, so we could try the full assortment of what they had to offer. 

When we came in, the hostess/waitress asked if we'd prefer to sit at the bar. Since this was our first time to Sushi Moto, we wanted a chance to peruse the menu at leisure with no pressure to order right away. I requested a table instead, and the lady seemed somewhat miffed by that, but brought us to a two-seater anyway. I mentioned that this was our first time, hoping to get some reccomendations, but after our drink order, she left us with the menus and no real explanation of what we were supposed to do next.

I've only ever been to Sushi Pier, where they leave a checklist of what sushi they offer. After you make your selections, they go off to make them. We had no such offering, but there --was-- a little call button on the edge of our table. We weren't sure if we were supposed to ring the bell when we were ready to make an order, or what. So we just waited until the waitress came back with our drinks. She pulled out a pen (which she kept dropping and having to pick up from under our table) and asked us what we wanted to eat.

My boyfriend and I had ordered the ""All-you-can-eat"" dinner special, of course, which is about $21.95 per person. I had heard that you could also get endless appetizers from the dinner menu, too, but that wasn't really the reason why we were checking this place out. (I did break down and tried the shrimp tempura appetizer towards the end, though. It wasn't anything exceptional, just the standard fried fare; if you've had one tempura shrimp, you've had them all, I guess. Not even the dipping sauce was very memorable. All I can recall was that it was some sweet soy sauce blend, but not very noteworthy.)

Let me say right now that Sushi Moto specializes in different long rolls and not much else. Sure, you have the typical Japanese cuisine, too, like terriyaki or udon, but when there is ""sushi"" in the restaurant name, you kind of expect that to be the prize winner. They have about 40 different long rolls, but when I say ""different"" I mean that they change up the ingredients here and there to make a ""new"" roll.

For example, I started with the Blast Roll (made with smoked salmon, cream cheese, cucumber and green onion). The smoked salmon was definately a change from typical sake/salmon that you find in most sushi. My boyfriend hates anything that tastes even remotely fishy, so I was sure he'd hate the smoked salmon, too. He managed to ingest it, though, much to my surprise, but I do have to say that smoked salmon does have a strong flavor, so buyer beware if you prefer a more subtle taste to your sushi.

Now, about four rolls down I found the Cilantro Roll, which is pretty much just the Blast Roll, only without the cream cheese and with cilantro instead.  And even further down, was the Steady Wild Ride, wich was, again, like the Blast Roll, only without the cucumber and now they fried it, tempura-style. 

Aside from the recycled ingredients, almost all of the long rolls are cooked in some way. I was hard pressed to find a single piece of raw fish in any of them. Sure, you can order the nigiri--and I did, to test the tobiko (flying fish roe) and the ebi (shrimp), both of which turned out to be just okay--but like I said earlier, Sushi Moto specializes in long rolls. For all the ""diversity"" of the menu, there really wasn't any.

We also tried the California Roll, the Cabin Fever (one of the ones with mango and macadamia nuts), the Friday Night (it had some sort of secret sauce on it that tasted suspiciously like plain mayonaise), the Maui Wowie (another one with mango and nuts), and the Spider Roll (the flavor of the smoked salmon killed everything else). We also ordered a Pandora's Box (with grilled asparagus, mushrooms, carrots, roasted garlic, carmalized red onions) and a Treading Lightly (with artichoke hearts, carrots, avocado, macadamia nuts, and black sesame seeds). 

By this point, I was rather sick of eating warm rolls. Everything had been served at room temperature or above, even the nigiri, which I assumed would have been cooler since it wasn't cooked like everything else. I was dying for some cold fish.

Since this review is out of room, let me summarize: Sushi Moto = just okay.",2008-02-23 01:01:17,Sushi Moto,"748 S Meadows Pkwy, Ste A-11",Reno,NV,39.437146,-119.757362,"Restaurants, Japanese, Sushi Bars"

The only downside is that the waiters were almost too attentive, taking away our dishes nearly seconds after we finished. Additionally, I felt like most of our dishes were on the sweeter side. A bit more salt would be preferred.

For more details on why I loved my meal...

Small hot dishes:
-short rib: really delicious flavor. Super tender!
-rib eye with scallions: similar flavor to the short rib. Also very good, but I preferred the short rib as I thought it was more flavorful.
-tuna with rice cracker: the cracker (basically a block of rice with a fried outside) was a bit tough. Overall liked it, but wouldn't recommend ordering it.
-pastrami bao bun: super unique dish. I love pastrami and thought the meat and slaw had good flavor, but there was way too much mustard on my piece. Would give this a try if you're looking for a fun, tasty bite.
-fried chicken with onions: hearty serving for $7. Not the best chicken I've had, but a good filler if you're not looking to completely blow your bank account.

Main:
-sea bass with pea shoots: Pretty decent hunk of fish. Had a great bright and crispy outside, and a nice sweet sauce on the plate. Our dish was a little cold, though. And I wish it was saltier. 
-black cod fried rice: ***this was probably my favorite dish! There were so many different elements to the rice which made it really delicious -- the saltiness of the cod (although honestly I would have preferred just a pinch of salt in the dish itself), sweetness of the caramel, spiciness of the peppers, and the pop of the edamame. 

Dessert:
-black sesame mocha: I like sesame so I enjoyed this dessert. Nothing super special, though.
-strawberry shortcake with sesame: would highly recommend this. Was a pretty big dessert so would be good for sharing. So delicious!",2018-02-10 02:39:15,Double Knot,120 S 13th St,Philadelphia,PA,39.9496993,-75.162185,"Nightlife, Sushi Bars, Cafes, Japanese, Bars, Restaurants"

Street parking here is way easier to find than in China Town, doesn't say much about the place but it's a hell of a lot easier to get to! It's a bit unsuspecting of a place, but when you see the fish tank, you know you're at a real Chinese place.
The decor and ambience was on par with most Chinese dim sum places, casual in the afternoon, but easily could suffice for a banquet at night. The service was good as well, always bringing us more water and giving us teapots with tea.
The food itself was incredible for most the part. They have the standard dim sum fare: shrimp and pork dumplings, chicken feet, shrimp with fun noodles, taro dumplings etc. The dim sum was great, and unless they mess it up, it's usually always great. The highlight was the adorable custard buns! The buns looked like little pigs, they're seriously the cutest buns ever! If the custard buns aren't your thing, they offer the same sort of buns that look like pigs, but they're filled instead with black sesame paste. I even tried their beef chow fun and I'll say it wasn't the greatest beef chow fun I've had. It wasn't bottom of the barrel, but it wasn't the greatest one I've had either. It was tasty but it definitely needed more ""wok hay"" which is wok heat/flavor. That being said, the beef was tasty and the fun noodles were super fresh, so they get points for that.

They were busy that night, so I don't know if that affected it, but the $20+ you pay should get you a little more thoughtfulness. The broccoli salad with black sesame and avocado, which I had high hopes for, was flavorless, and I felt like I was eating cold, plain, previously steamed broccoli, avocado nearly absent and while there was a lot of black sesame, it didn't carry any flavor.

The chains also have you set with Ruth's Chris and Smith & Wollensky, of which the latter is one of my favorites in NYC. And of course, you've also got Del Frisco's, a ""chain"" steakhouse that embodies all things power lunch or expense accounts. And regular readers know that, at least in my opinion, higher-end chains like Ruth's Chris and Del Frisco's are nothing to scoff at. If anything they have consistent execution and service down pat.

Philly's outpost for Del Frisco's is cavernous. It all starts with the iron-clad gates that welcome you in. You can venture downstairs and have your meal in a bank vault. 

Or enter straight ahead and enjoy a drink at the bar, with the vaulted ceilings providing a grand atmosphere. 

Or do as the GF and I did and reserve a table upstairs to overlook it all, right next to a spiral staircase filled with hundreds, if not thousands of bottles of wine.

Old Fashioned [$14]
Knob Creek bourbon, muddled cherry, orange, sugar, bitters

I started the meal with an oft-enjoyed cocktail. Can't go wrong with Knob Creek - the orange helped to add some lightness to this well-made drink.

Diet Coke [$4]

The GF wasn't feeling a drink that night, so went with a Diet Coke. FYI - this is the type of place that won't invest in fountain soda, for reasons that are financially obvious. Interestingly though, the soda was initially completely flat. No carbonation whatsoever. The server was a bit flummoxed as well, but once we offered her a taste to dispel any disbelief (which she declined), she brought us another which was just fine. Weird.

Bread Service

The meal starts off with bread service - crusty, yeasty, and salty sesame bread. Whipped butter was served at room temp, which is always appreciated. The server stopped by to ask if we wanted some more bread, but we decided to save room for what was to come.

Del's Salad [$10]

The GF ordered the house salad, which the servers graciously split for us, much to the chagrin of the GF. A thick-cut, crispy piece of bacon sat atop Romaine and field greens, in addition to a melange of cherry tomatoes, carrots, avocado, green onions, and croutons. Ranch dressing was provided as well.

Fried Calamari [$17]
Shanghai style 

This was our second time at Del Frisco's in Philly and we had to order the calamari again. Sweet and crispy, the calamari had a nice bit of head on the end. The mung bean sprouts and pickled jalapeno offered some texture and tang, with the sweetness of the black sesame accenting the delicious sauce. Highly recommended.

8 oz. Filet Mignon [$39]

The GF went with the 8 ounce filet, cooked nicely medium-rare. This is USDA prime beef, though not aged. It had great flavor with a tenderness that's prototypical of the filet. The crust was nicely seasoned and accentuated the beef. Unfortunately, here, they cut into the steak before bringing it to your table. Understandably, they want to get the temperature correct before their patrons dig in, but in my mind, it brings down the experience a bit, especially at these prices.

16 oz. Ribeye [$45]

As expected, I went with the ribeye which was beautifully seasoned on the outside. This USDA prime beef is wet-aged for 16 to 18 days. While I give the nod to Ruth's Chris's ribeye for their superlative crust, this was still quite delicious. The deckle or cap of the steak was gorgeously marbled - clearly my favorite cut on the steak.

Onion Rings [$10]

Knowing the belly of this pig, you'd expect me to order a few sides as well. For me, a steakhouse's sides are often measured by their onions rings. Though not as crispy as other steakhouses, these were huge and had a creamy batter - reminiscent of a malt/vinegar fish n chips batter.

Lobster Mac n Cheese [$18]

When I see lobster mac n cheese on the menu, it will be ordered. This was creamy and the briny essence of the lobster comes through nicely, with a few chunks of lobster interspersed throughout. The top of the mac n cheese was nicely crispy, offering some texture to each bite. 

And with that, our meal was over, with plenty of leftovers for the next day. Other than the flat soda ($4!!), the meal was on point and service was excellent. Though Barclay Prime and Ruth's Chris remain my favorites in Philly, Del Frisco's offers a great meal as well. Not that Kanye West and Kim Kardashian's choices for fine dining are anything to consider (they're not), but they did enjoy a meal here when they were last in town.

Any one of these factors would have brought us back, but the combination of thoughtful food, nice ambience, and superb service will have us highly recommending Etch to any and all visiting Nashville.",2019-01-30 15:58:05,Etch,303 Demonbreun St,Nashville,TN,36.159155872,-86.7751615038,"Desserts, Wine Bars, Restaurants, Event Planning & Services, Seafood, Food, Nightlife, Bars, Middle Eastern, Venues & Event Spaces, Asian Fusion, Mediterranean, American (New), Salad"

The space overall is big and the chef's counter is quieter than the main bar area.

I opted for the chef's tasting and actually went blind- I let the chef choose and he did not disappoint. You get 10 dishes and a dessert. The notable items I got:
-yellowtail toro sushi: the bite left such a tender citrusy burst, a great start
-kobe beef yakitori: so juicy and tender, seared to perfection - must drizzle the mustard sauce on the side 
-scallop yakitori: my favorite- somehow the chef magically knew I loved scallops? Just slightly charred and each bite was just perfect, miso glaze added a nice touch - if you love seafood, need to put dibs on this! 
- broiled sea bass: served with some garnished veggies and drizzled in miso/teriyaki sauce, the filet was not over cooked and the flavor was just great 
- black sesame ice cream mochi: soft mochi with cold black sesame ice cream filling - the best sweet note and treat to end your night

The deal being $60 pretax was amazing for the amount of food you get (there was more than listed, I just put down the ones I loved). The whole 10 courses took around 1.5 hours at my slow pace though I wished they waited for me to finish each one before the next one came out. I definitely would come back again and maybe see what the chef can surprise me with again!

- Japancake [ SHREDDED SAVORY CABBAGE, AIOLI, JALAPENO, MB HOT SAUCE ] Added a fried egg: Tasted like straight up pickled cabbage. The fried egg made it less vinegar-y but there weren't any other flavors.

- What's Kraken? [ TOAST, BLACK SESAME SPREAD, CHORIZO, OCTOPUS, GIARDINIERA ]: Octopus was over cooked and chewy. The black sesame spread looked like a poop smear on the plate and you couldn't even scrap any of it off the plate because it had hardened. There was barely any chorizo. Not good at all.

- Southern Livin' [ FRIED PICKLED OKRA, CORN CHOW CHOW, HEIRLOOM TOMATO REMOULADE ]:  Not bad. My second best dish of the night. Doesn't mean much though. It was just fried okra.

- Tatchos [ TATER TOTS, LAMB CHILI, BEER CHEDDAR, SCALLION ]: Best dish of the night. The lamb chili had a game-y taste that's to be expected and it was still edible.

We came here for a belated bday celebration  and the first good omen was its location, in the former spot that I enjoyed many meals at when it was Indeblue. Then it dawned on me that with ""Z"" being so close, the chef(s) must have some cojones to set down roots here. 

From that start most of the food that followed affirmed the rating. We both did the $75 tasting and selected different dishes so most of the menu could be sampled. I won't list everything but top dishes for me were both ""snacks"" crispy asparagus and the beets and radishes were both simple concepts, but they both showcased and elevated those ingredients in unique ways. Next,  the 3 tomato salad was one of my top salads ever( I am an admitted tomato-phile) it contained fried, fresh and oven dried specimens, but the addition of green chick peas and the incredible thick oven dried bacon made this very special. All courses that contained seafood were perfect, the soft shell crab was one of the plumpest I've seen, and it was pan sautéed to perfection, my red snapper main and cotaster's scallops were equally well done. The standout dessert of this trip was the deconstructed black sesame cheesecake, WOW! 

When I mulled this one over I considered many things, price to portion and quality ratio was perhaps the biggest. My complaint and something I notice other Yelpers comment on when reviewing tasting menus is portion size. This had to be the most food I've ever had during a meal like this. Usually the portion size of each dish is reduced, if so it was not noticeable except in one of the desserts and the scallop main. Another factor is how many dishes fell short, in my opinion there was only 1 in 10 that I would not reorder, and one dessert that while very tasty, was minuscule( chocolate mouse) Lastly there is the service component. Our waiter Jordan was possibly the best I've encountered in several years. Not only was he able to explain each ingredient of all courses, he gave great recommendations and was very passionate and excited about all of it. He was attentive, funny and helped us enjoy the experience more. 

There are a few other restaurants of this caliber nearby, and although I haven't gotten to(all of)them yet I feel pretty confident that this one stands up.

They accommodated me by just bringing me half their usual small bowl so I could try it out.  It was extremely good!  Then I ordered the ""Chicago"" dog (hot dog) off the regular lunch menu.  Why a hot dog at an upscale place you ask?  Well usually they can get quite messy when you add lots of condiments so I prefer to eat them sitting down at a table vs. in the car from a truck or a pit stop.  Now this dog beat all others because it had the best relish I've ever tasted.  The relish was ""home-made"" and complimented the dog perfectly.  But there were other things too, like a black sesame seed bun, and an extremely tasty dog, that made this far superior than your usual dog.  The dressing on the greens that came with it was unique and very tasty as well.

But the thing that struck me the most, was the service.  It was faster than a fast food joint.  And the server opened the door for us to leave.  Yeah some chains use a hostess for that but I think its nicer when the server does it to complete the dining experience.  Also, there were several ""check-ins"" at our table to make sure everything was A-Ok, which is always a major reward for the server.

Yeah its a little bit more pricey for a lunch but then hey, you can't get unique taste, fast service, something new you've never had before (the home-made relish), without laying down a few extra dollars.",2012-01-21 05:14:16,Jax Kitchen,7286 N Oracle Rd,Tucson,AZ,32.3371398,-110.9773377,"Restaurants, American (New)"

The Japancake which was smothered in MB Hot Sauce.  It was the blandest cabbage cake swimming in a tangy yet flavorless thin ""hot sauce"".

What's Kraken? TOAST, BLACK SESAME SPREAD, CHORIZO, OCTOPUS, GIARDINIERA.
The octopus was served on Texas Toast, virtually no chorizo, no giardiniera, the octopus was cooked nicely, and the black sesame spread was tasty.

Unbeetable
BEET SALAD, FIG MOSTRADA, GOAT FETA, CACAO NIBS, ORANGE SHERRY VINEGAR
Beets yes, Salad no.  Their beets were almost delicious but they overdressed with the mostrada and vinegar.  No leafy greens just sweet upon sweet with no textural components.

Entrees:
Three's Company
MB BACON-SIRLOIN-CHORIZO MEATLOAF, FRIED EGG, TEXAS TOAST, ADOBO GRAVY
was served on top of yet another piece of Texas Toast.  It was a good textural component because the meatloaf needed it.  The meatloaf tasted pretty good, but was cheapened by the Texas Toast.  This dish definitely was not worth $20.

Poultry in Motion
CARAMEL CHICKEN, BREAST AND LEG, SPICY UMAMI SAUCE
was fried chicken & mashed potatoes.  Definitely not worth $21.

The menu is really extensive! There's definitely something for everyone, kids included!

We started with some ""Japas"" aka Japanese tapas!! We enjoyed agedaahi tofu and edamame, then moved on to ""Yaikatori"" aka skewers. We had they shrimp and shishito, and both were wonderful! The starter that really stole the show however, were the brussels! They were INSANE! Hands down, the bet I've ever had!! My husband and youngest who aren't fans normally, LOVED these!! 

The kiddos had simple avocado and green rolls, while hubs and I dove into some specialty rolls that were outrageous! The 'He Roll' has scorched scallops that gave it an unexpected smokey flavor. The 'Rocket Roll' featured cold lobster salad atop salmon with sweet apple that balanced the wasabi tobiko so well! It was wrapped with black sesame soy paper. So neat!  

We also split the whole grilled bronzini, which is actually a pike fish, and was a steal at just $18! 

We finished, or shall I say, the kids finished the meal with tempura ice cream. They devoured it before we could grab a bite! The mochi flight is what's up for us next time, oh, and the lobster two ways!! Yaaaassss! 

Service from Aaron was stellar and the cocktails and imported Japanese beer were the perfect accompaniment. Shirley Temples for the kids!

I came here for dinner with my brother on Friday night, and we left extremely satisfied. The Mockingbird elevates classic comfort food dishes, and incorporates multiple food cultures to create unique experiences. 

SERVICE: Our waitress was DIVINE. She was passionate about the opening of the restaurant, extremely knowledgeable of the menu, and was very attentive - our drink glasses were NEVER empty!

FOOD: The food was SOOOO good. Here's what we ate: 

Don't Worry Brie Happy: 4 mini brie grilled cheeses, with jalapeno jam and topped with a chimicurri. These were outstanding mini grilled cheeses, and perfect for sharing! They were the perfect combination of sweet and salty, and super crispy on the outside. I personally would have liked more cheese, because who wouldn't, but my brother says ""I'm a cheese guy, and I think they're perfect the way they are"".  

What's Kraken: Pieces of toast with black sesame spread, octopus, and chorizo. We were unsure what to expect of this dish, and while it was tasty, it still is a bit confusing. The octopus and chorizo were good, but the spread was hard to taste, and the toast was a ~~different~~ way to serve this food. I'm not sure I would order this again. 

Seoul Purpose: Slices of bulgogi style hangar steak, served with a waffled latke topped with a fried egg, and some greens. I don't even like steak, but this was SO. SO. GOOD. The meat was super flavorful, and it was an interesting new flavor I have never had before. The latke and waffle were also a great side, as well as the greens. The steak was cooked perfectly. Definitely order this!!

Sea Signore: Housemade spaghetti with crab, corn, some peppers, and a spicy chili sauce. HANDS DOWN the best part of the meal. The pasta was so creamy, and was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet. It was melt in your mouth good and no other words can do it justice.

Got another one of those because of how good it was. The two sushi rolls we got were the one named after the place and some other roll I forget the name, loved both but the rolls weren't what stood out to me about this meal. Edamame dumplings that were sooo good and like a hug. The sea bass which was..... phenomenal. My other favorite thing we ate was a DUCK SCRAPPLE bao bun, UNREALLLLL good. And then least favorite thing was a wild mushroom gyoza, which I feel like had the potential to be good but it came in like a vinaigrette broth kinda thing and I wish they had a more creamy element because I thought it would complement the mushrooms better, I didn't like the acidity and bitterness of the broth. And then also a salmon skewer which was also amazing. OH and the best mochi ice cream I've ever had for desert, flavors were matcha, black sesame, and salted caramel.

Downstairs, it was equally as crowded, with patrons filling every table, and a very ""weekend"" vibe with the dim lighting and close quarters.

The bite ranges from soft to crispy to chewy all at once, and is a textural party in your mouth!

SALMON - specialty sashimi // Thinly sliced pieces of fresh salmon, in a spicy ponzu sauce and topped with soy ginger + scallions. This dish lets the fresh salmon do the talking!

TOFU - crispy // Normally tofu goes unnoticed while on the table, if people even order it at all. But not this tofu! This tofu is fried until it is extremely crispy on the outside, but with a pillowy interior that disintegrates in your mouth. The tofu has two sauces: a pesto and a miso caramel, which both stand out against the mild tofu. Even those who were opposed to ordering tofu helped scarf down this crispy delicacy! 

EDAMAME DUMPLING - small // These little dumps were adorable! The dumplings had a smooth, mild filling made with ground edamame. The flavor was very mellow, yet intriguing. Apparently these are one of the best sellers at Double Knot.

CHICKEN BREAST - robatayaki // Probably the least impressive dish in the meal. The chicken was cooked well, but lacked an explosive flavor compared to the other dishes. 

RIB EYE SCALLION - robatayaki // This was INCREDIBLE, and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like steak. The rib eye was so incredibly tender and juicy, it just melted in the mouth after the first bite. It was topped with a green scallion sauce that was so dynamite, it could have bene paired with cardboard and I'd eat it. Definitely the robatayaki to get!

BEEF SHORT RIB - meat // This was MASSIVE. And so DELICIOUS. The short rib comes to the table whole, and is shredded in front of you. The meat is succulent in the flavorful miso sauce. It's served with lettuce cups and white rice to make lettuce wraps, or you can just jab it with your fork and shovel as much as you possibly can into your mouth.

BROILED SEABASS - fish // By the time this dish came, we were filling up, and I don't think it got the attention it deserved. The seabass was cooked to just past the point of being raw (aka perfect), with glistening insides and a truffle soy glaze on the plate. A simple, understated, perfectly cooked fish. 

CRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUTS - sides // These were good, but not great. The brussels are super crispy, which I loved, and served in a salty fish sauce. While I typically love brussels served like this, I felt the sauce was a bit too pungent or salty, and it made it hard to eat a lot of these.

SPICY TUNA ROLL - sushi // Standard, spicy tuna roll. Fresh fish. 

MOCHI // The tasing menu comes with complimentary mochi. We had two flavors: black sesame and strawberry. These mochi were on the bigger side, with a chewy exterior. The strawberry was a little too sweet for me, but the black sesame tasted like a more mild peanut butter. So delicious and unexpected!!

Double Knot is definitely a spot I will be back to. Will I need to do the tasting menu again? Perhaps, but it was a lot of food. If I were to do it again, I would let the chef choose the menu so I could try some dishes I wouldn't normally. There's tons to chose from the expansive menu, and it's perfect for a weekend dinner or a date night.",2018-04-17 00:41:20,Double Knot,120 S 13th St,Philadelphia,PA,39.9496993,-75.162185,"Nightlife, Sushi Bars, Cafes, Japanese, Bars, Restaurants"

The menu changes seasonally and everything is farm to fork. I came here on a Wednesday night around 8PM, and there were three other tables occupied. The staff was very attentive and professional.

We chose the five course tasting menu - usually $75, but the night we went, they had a promotion and it was only $55 for the tasting menu. 

First they started us off with complimentary sourdough fococcia.

For the snacks, we ordered the crispy asparagus and shrimp. I loved the sauces for both dishes, I even dipped the sourdough in the sauces. I liked that the smoked aioli (that came with the asparagus) had a nice kick to it. 

For the small plates we ordered the tomato salad and steak tartare. The tomato salad portion was huge! The tomatoes were very sweet. The dressing went perfect with the tomatoes. The steak tartare was delicious. It was nicely seasoned and I loved the flavors from the sautéed onions and pepper relish. I was disappointed they did not have the soft shell crab (my favorite), but it was no longer in season.

For grains and pasta, we ordered the black chittara and sunchoce agnolotti. The butter flavor in the black chittara dish was perfect. The lobster tasted very fresh. The sunchoce agnolotti dish was a bit too sour for me - not sure if they squeezed too much lemon on top, but it was very sour.

For large plates, we ordered the market fish (forget what fish we had) and bavette-steak. I loved the grain that was served with the fish- super flavorful. The fish was cooked perfectly. I must say, the steak was my favor. The black garlic sauce along with the charred flavor of the steak was perfect.

For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse and black sesame cheesecake. The chocolate mousse tasted good, but it was more of a firm jello texture than mousse. The deconstructed black sesame cheesecake was interesting. I did not like the flavor of black sesame cheesecake by itself. When it was mixed with the black sesame cracker and whipped cream, it tasted better.

Overall, a very good first experience at P&P.",2019-09-26 03:20:46,Porch & Proper,619 W Collings Ave,Oaklyn,NJ,39.9110783,-75.0848635,"Restaurants, American (New)"

I can cope with waiting on food if the meal is outstanding, and a middle of the road meal can be improved by quick and attentive service. Unfortunately, neither side of the equation made me want a repeat visit to Sushi? OK, located in a building that has housed a variety of eateries over the years.

The place was packed with families having dinner, so perhaps they were short on supplies; we were provided a single menu for the table to share. However, the order slip included half the items listed on the extensive menu, and some others that weren't listed at all. We wrote a few selections in the margins and hoped for the best.

Receiving anything other than drinks took a very long time. Appetizers took about 30 minutes, and there were long pauses between plates after that. From the sizeable list of appetizers we kept it simple with potstickers, miso soup, and baked mussels. The soup and potstickers were tasty, but served at lukewarm temperature. More disappointing were nicely seasoned, spicy mussels that were served stone cold. At least my sake was served a bit warmer, though not really hot. Last and oddest, we were presented with napkins, utensils, and condiment dishes, but had to ask for pickled ginger and wasabi after our first dishes arrived.

Although I appreciate hand and long rolls, nigiri sushi is my favorite. The rice-to-fish ratio and freshness of fish were adequate. I sampled tuna, yellowtail, salmon, snapper, and mackerel--which was about as fresh-tasting as any mackerel I've had in Reno--but my orders of fresh water eel and octopus were missing in action.

Moving on to complex nigiri, the upside down shrimp was topped with rice, raw bay scallop, scallion, black sesame seed, and Japanese mayo, followed by the Volcano, a big piece of yellowtail rolled around a ball of rice, topped with raw bay scallop, scallion, black sesame seed, and Japanese mayo. The Hollywood featured rice topped with sliced, raw jumbo scallop topped with cooked sea scallop, sesame seeds, and toasted sesame oil. Finally, the Sexy Dory upside down shrimp topped with rice, sea scallop, scallion, and toasted sesame oil. Overall, the flavors of the two variations on upside down shrimp and the Volcano were quite sweet and mostly indistinguishable from one another. The Hollywood stood out on flavor and texture, most definitely something I would order again.

Our first long roll was the Sancho, a mix of jalapeno, crystal shrimp, salmon, avocado, spicy crab, cilantro, lemon, and teriyaki sauce. Mostly I tasted rice, sweet with a bit of heat. A Show roll of crystal shrimp, jalapeno, spicy crab, and seared tuna had quite a bit of spice, cut by crab salad with a lot of mayo, while the Guerra Fire roll's mix of salmon, crystal shrimp, lemon, and sesame seed was a bit overpowered by a seriously fiery habanero sauce. We used bites of deep-fried Jumbo roll--shrimp, crab, cream cheese, sweet teriyaki--to cut the heat, though I really couldn't taste any fish flavors through the cream cheese, batter, and sauce.

Three other rolls had been ordered but apparently forgotten, so we decided to just skip them and move on. Sitting for two hours for a partial order is about my limit for adequate-to-mediocre food.",2017-01-30 00:20:20,Sushi?

Our favorites were the Thai Iced Tea Ice Rolls and Black Sesame Snow Ice. They were delicious and the toppings were great too. Each was about $6.

The thing is, it took a while. I understand that they are going to add more stations or automate it (machine) in the future, but it's tough to make your customers loyal when it takes 20 minutes or more. 

We came this past Sunday after lunch and there wasn't a huge wait. I can't imagine if there is a line out the door. You could wait 45 min for an ice cream.

I'll be honest- I have really high expectations when it comes to Asian food because 1) I'm Asian!! When I moved to Santa Barbara for college, all I ever craved was Asian food. I tried Pattaya and TAP thai but they were both just okay and never fully satisfied my thai food cravings. THANK GOODNESS that I discovered this place!!! This place serves AUTHENTIC thai food! Everything I've tried here is delicious- pad thai, panang curry, pad see ew and the mongolian beef. My favorite dish here though is the panang curry. They have lunch specials where certain dishes come with an eggroll and soup or salad. 
Also, the ice cream here is AMAZING! I've tried the cookies and thai tea ice cream and the vietnamese coffee mudpie. Their ice cream is made right on the spot (homemade ice cream!!!) They have other unique flavors such as roasted black sesame ice cream and basil mint chip.

I was not expecting such great Asian fusion in Nashville, especially when most of the popular restaurants in town have the same type of foods - hot chicken or BBQ meats. I was really impressed with the uniqueness of the items we ordered, as well as my unexpected enjoyment of items that I was sure I would not like. 

We tried almost all of the dumplings since we were a party of eight. Most of the table enjoyed the Shrimp Stuffed Eggplant the most, but my favorite was the Fire Cracker Wontons. 

For the entree, we ordered several items to share family style: Hong Kong Style Cumin Short Rib, Dry Fry Sichuan Beef, Kung Pao Cauliflower, and Hangzhou Late Night Noodles. I thought the short ribs and noodles would be my favorites, but the dry fry beef and cauliflower were the winners according to my taste buds. This really surprised me as I typically avoid fried food (don't like a lot of grease) and cauliflower has never been a favorite. I still enjoyed the short ribs and noodles as both of those were good, but the beef and cauliflower were the items I kept eating long after I should have cut myself off.

I should mention that we also ordered a few sides: General Tso's Brussel Sprouts, Crispy Togarashi Potatoes, and Szechuan Dry Fry Okra. All three were very good. 

We figured we should get dessert since everything else had been so great so far. We ordered the Black Sesame Creme Brûlée and the White Chocolate Cake with passion fruit caramel to share.  Both were so, so unique. I wasn't in love with the matcha-flavored creme brûlée, but I'm still glad we tried it.  The cake was good, but I don't know if it was that memorable.

We did a good mix of seafood and meat dishes and all were delicious. In the chefs tasting you pick one item from each section and two from the robatayaki grill section, for this we did the Kobe beef and shrimp, both were delicious and the Kobe beef was cooked perfectly and was so tender.

Some of our favorites from the tasting menu were the hanger steak, the miso sea bass, and the Kobe beef robatayaki. The one dish I felt could use more flavor was the crab udon. They did serve them in a small bowl for each person which was nice to not share (which would probably be messy). It was still really good but I think more spice/kick to it would have made it better.

We chose to go a la carte as opposed to the $75 tasting menu and even so, we managed to try 2/3 of the menu.  Overall the food was 5-star good in taste and presentation.  Here's what we had:

The entire 'snacks' section of crispy asparagus (phenomenal), beets & radishes (very good), three proper shrimp (very good) & tiger cucumbers (very good).

From the 'grains & pasta' section we tried the Black Chittara with Maine lobster, truffle butter and chilies - outstanding dish, very good.
Two of the 'small plates' section items of Steak Tartare (very, very good) and the Tuna in the raw (very good).

From the 'Large Plates' section, we ordered the Market Fish which happened to be cod and it was excellent.  The Sea Scallops were also very good, well-cooked and two of us had the Bavette which was delicious and perfectly cooked as well.  

For 'dessert', we had all four of the offerings: Wood Smoked Chocolate Mousse (very good, but a bit too smoky for two of us), Baby Chouxs (sounded great, tasted ok but the choux were a bit soggy), Cheese Plate (great cheeses but very similar in taste and the accoutrements of granola and fennel jam were not good for any of us, unfortunately.  The macerated cherries with the cheesecake, though were delicious with the cheese) and finally the best dessert for all of us was the Black Sesame Cheesecake.  Visually interesting, great taste and texture combinations - a dessert home run.  The coffee was also very good.

We had a great dinner in a great space with great service and I think we all agreed that we'd rate Porch & Proper a solid 4 or 4.5.  We definitely would be back, possibly frequently as the food and service were that good.  

Here are the plusses:

Great service by Jordan from beginning to end and kudos for getting the cork out of a 1989 Vouvray perfectly.  We would definitely request Jordan on any return visit.

Beautifully presented plates and delicious food - very good.

Great ambiance

Here are the minuses:

The only bread available was the focaccia, and while good; it seemed to have been made for the accompanying ricotta spread (which was very good) but it did not go well with the cheese plate and for my preference; there should have been some baguette, toasts or crackers for the cheese plate.

Two of us ordered the Bavette and my dining partner had a nice swath of demi sauce on his plate while I had practically none, so the plating consistency was just a bit off.

The cheese plate was just not up to the standard of all of the other dishes.  The cheeses were very similar in taste, the granola and the fennel jam were just not very good accompaniments (in the opinion of two of us who order and prepare cheese plates often) which left the cheese plate very one-note.

Finally, the choux were ok but not up to the level of the mousse and the black sesame cheesecake - again, just our opinion and we know tastes vary.  Also - not trying to be obnoxious at all - choux is already the plural of chou so no need for the 's' at the end of choux.  Chouxs is not a word.

Overall, Porch & Proper more than delivered on the promise and on the past reviews by other - a very, very good restaurant with very, very good food and service.  We will definitely be back and I'm sure it will be often.

Got another one of those because of how good it was. The two sushi rolls we got were the one named after the place and some other roll I forget the name, loved both but the rolls weren't what stood out to me about this meal.

And then least favorite thing was a wild mushroom gyoza, which I feel like had the potential to be good but it came in like a vinaigrette broth kinda thing and I wish they had a more creamy element because I thought it would complement the mushrooms better, I didn't like the acidity and bitterness of the broth. And then also a salmon skewer which was also amazing. OH and the best mochi ice cream I've ever had for desert, flavors were matcha, black sesame, and salted caramel.

I've been to Shanghai 456 many times now having taken friends, family and co-workers and they've all loved it. If you want a more in-depth review, take a look here.

Took J and L out for an early Friday dinner. They've never had XLB's before or Shanghai food for that matter. My mind was blown and clearly I had to do my duty and show them the ropes. That and try a couple new dishes obviously.

- Fun see ($16.95) - this one is on their special menu but if you want something different and absolutely delicious, order it! Just point to the picture on the menu. These noodles have the perfect, chewy bite. I'd order this again in a heartbeat.

- Bok choy (E16) ($11.95) - Shanghai bok choy stir fried with garlic sauce. They were out of their green beans with x.o. sauce - HOW is that even possible - so we went with something simple. Sometimes simple is best.

- Xiao long bao (A2) ($6.95) - obviously, we ordered two baskets of XLB's because one is never enough. Each basket contains six of the most plump, juicy, delicious soup filled dumplings you will find in the city. Hands down. Give it a little bath in the vinegar soy sauce and be prepared to be blown away. Always a must order.

- House special hot pot (C7) ($21.95 medium) - hot pot with homemade fish balls, salty pork belly slices, meat, vegetables and glass noodles. I've had this before on another occasion but we wanted something warm to fill our stomachs. This hit the spot with a good variety of vegetables inside (enoki mushrooms, bok choy, tofu, cabbage). The meat itself is meh - too salty but that's to be expected for this type of dish. However, the broth is flavourful and the glass noodles add that chewy, comforting texture to bring things together.

- Wor tip (A3) ($7.50) - pan fried beef dumplings. These came out last but holy crap, it was piping hot. Seriously, Jman burnt his tongue because he couldn't wait. Excellent crispy dumplings and with a bit of soup inside them as well, watch out.

- Sesame balls - they always bring something at the end for dessert and this time it was sesame balls with black sesame paste inside. Fresh, hot and gooey. I think L fell in love with this one - she wanted a couple more to take home.

What more is there to say? Each time that I hit up the 456, I'm always happy and get my fill of XLB's.

Which is exactly why Kuriimii is bringing a much needed addition to Chinatown - SOFT SERVE ice cream! ... which is also why I am a big fan, not to mention the Asian inspired flavors to choose from.

Pros:
- Flavors (changes regularly) 
* Black Sesame: nutty, perfect for a black sesame fan but could be stronger in flavor 
* Matcha: no one can agree against green tea, good but typical  
* Black Sesame & Matcha swirl -- perfect balance of the two
*Avocado: rich, creamy, just like an avocado smoothie but in ice cream form. (warning: acquired taste)
- Taro: like taro. 

Tips & Improvements: 
- Because it is soft serve, be mindful of it melting like the polar ice caps. That being said, be smart whether you want a cone or a cup. I had a friend who got a cone, and she would be slurping her ice cream mid-sentence every 5 second.

The actual shaved ice, I was less impressed with. I got the taro and it was really flavorless, my friend got the black sesame which was better but def not the best taiwanese shaved ice I've had. The texture of the ice is really well done, but I think they need to add more flavor. Very instragrammable (if that's a word) since it looks very aesthetically pleasing but the taste doesn't match the looks.

Toppings were unlimited and extensive, including fruity pebbles, freshly torched marshmallow, chocolate powder, coconut shavings, etc! Each ice cream was twisted to perfection and the toppings added even more goodness. The flavors were on point and texture was smooth and creamy. Not too sweet, not overly rich - just right.

For a mere $10, you can enjoy miso soup (savory and rich, not watery at all), a green salad (sprinkled with black sesame seeds and a light ginger dressing) and two rolls from the list provided. I ordered my favorites: spicy tuna and salmoncado (this roll was not on the list, and had a $1 upcharge, but whatever). Michelle C ordered green tea for the both of us, which was served in a fancy handle-less mug, and had hints of an earthy rice flavor.

The rolls aren't massive, but I liked it that way. The rice:fish ratio is on point. No globs of rice falling off any piece. Both the tuna and salmon tasted fresher than any other sushi I've tasted in Philadelphia. 

Service was, if anything, too good. There are only so many times a two-top happily eating their sushi needs to be checked up on.

The store itself was spacious. When I went, there were almost no decorations. All the furniture is white. I didn't like how they positioned their tables; they were so close together that it was hard to move without asking the other people sitting at other tables to move their chairs.

And yeah, they say ""limitless toppings"", but it feels just a bit misleading in that they only put a minimum amount of each type of topping and the toppings available are very inconsistent (i.e. no teddy bears even when it was advertised on the board). 

I had the taro and the black sesame when I visited, and the taro was okay but nothing to rave about. Black sesame was actually rather unpalatable, with an oddly spicy and bitter flavor. I wasn't the only person who thought so; 4 out of the 5 people who were there didn't even want a second bite of the black sesame. To be fair, some of them had tried the black sesame flavor there before and said that it had tasted different/better previously. I generally like black sesame flavors, but perhaps they wanted it to be stronger given previous reviews and it happened to backfire.

Atmosphere - I loved the furniture, which was made by someone locally (Fernley maybe?) from reclaimed woods, and we sat at a long, hightop, that could have sat maybe 8 or 10?

We stopped in on Friday night, for their tapas menu.  Here's what we ordered:

Crispy friend monkfish, soy sake broth, wasabi creme - $11

Pernod Steamed PEI mussles, grape tomatoes, jalapeno bacon - $13

Smoke pork enchiladas, machego and oaxaca - $9

Russian ghost cone, espresso ice cream, and chocolate souffle - $11

I really liked the monkfish, and though the presentation was great, with julienne veggies and seaweed for accents, black sesame atop the wasabi creme, etc.  Flavors blended well too.

The mussels were fine - no wow factor here, but just solid mussels.

Enchiladas were a bit of a miss - they were closer to lukewarm than warm, and were just kind of there.

The dessert was great - delicous souffle, and the ghost cone was this thin, gelatinous film, that complimented the espresso ice cream well.  The ice cream was maybe a bit too smooth, but overall a good dessert.

The reason I'm torn is mainly since I expected a tapas menu to be a bit more affordable.  The price point was definitely higher than expected.  Menu was rad and innovative, but considering that 2 of the 4 items we had were a bit of a miss, I don't think the GF and I had a $45 meal.

Oh, wait a minute. One is empty. If you give us a couple of minutes to get it cleared it's yours. Thanks! We'll take it. So we got to sit on the patio both facing the street to watch all of the people and costumes from the comfort of a table on the patio! Yay! Now that's worth a $5 cover.

I showed this to the server and she said she'd bring it right out. We looked over the menu and ordered some sushi. Out came the hummus and it was delicious!

gBLqmqXC3Kz7HSj5ePgGDA,rUYDeEtzj_cag8LzofKByg,Cmw00BFD1l-_DJHPuKi2Rw,5.0,0,0,0,"Upon walking in Ciccio's, I instantly knew we would be in for a treat. The unique thing about Ciccio's is that it is technically two restaurants in one. Ciccio's California Cuisine and Ciccio's Water. The menu is vast, offering everything from California noodle bowls to gourmet sushi and everything in between. The specialty menu switches monthly and they keep it non hectic by having two kitchens, one for the Sushi and one for everything else. Also, Ciccio's gets the majority of their products local.

We started off by sampling the famous Slam-Gria. A giant glass of homemade sangria, offered in red, champagne and white. Our table tried one of each. My personal favorite was the red. 

Out first item off the menu was Tuna Bruschetta: Pistachio Wasabi Crusted Seared Tuna with edamame hummus, seaweed salad and soy ginger vinaigrette. It was amazing. The Tuna was perfectly seared to have the pistachio crust. The flavors really complemented one another.

Up next was Filet Mignon Quesadilla's: Strips of filet mignon, black beans, roasted poblanos, cilantro, spicy corn guacamole, jack cheese and sour cream. My boyfriend really enjoyed this dish and has asked me to make it at home.

One of my favorite dishes of the night was Lobster Mac and Cheese with Truffle Oil Drizzle. Ermahgerd....This dish was beyond. Rich, savory, delicious, creamy, cheesy, truffle, lobster goodness. I told Ciccio's Manager Steve that they should put this in a New England Style Hot Dog Roll and make a Lobster Mac and Cheese roll out of it. 

After savoring those three items, out came three rolls of sushi. Up first was the Spicy Diablo Roll which was amazing: Ahi tuna, tempura onions, topped with spicy tuna, beet tobbikko, daikon sprouts, and sriracha aioli and sesame seeds. We also had one of the monthly specials, Sleepy Hallow: Spicy ahi tuna, cucumber, mango, avocado, topped with zesty spicy aioli marinated Maine lobster meat, black sesame seeds, beet tobbiko and tempura spinach. 

Next came out two pizza's. The Chicken Marsala Pizza, which was delicious. I need the recipe for Ciccio's homemade marsala sauce. Along with the ""Almost Gluten Free Thin Crusted Pizza"". 8 inch single serving with fresh tomato sauce, basil and mozzarella. You can include a variety of toppings and there are only traces of gluten (22 carbs include fiber). This pizza was simple and delicious.

Time for more cocktails, I tried the Cucumber - Muddled cucumber and sugar, Absolut Vodka, St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, fresh lime and a splash of club soda. Katie tried the Zen Cosmopolitan - Gekkeikan Sake, Triple Sec, Lime, Cranberry Juice. The cucumber was very refreshing and I could probably drink  too many of them. My friend Katie ordered the Zen Cosmo was made with Sake so it had a different twist to the classic cosmo. It was great!

I have heard wonderful things about Ciccio's California bowls. They are known for the variety of options, everyone will find something on the menu that they would love. You choose to have your bowl served with steamed yellow, sticky rice, brown rice, farro (add $1) or chilled Asian noodles (add $2). We tried the Thai Chicken Bowl,  napa cabbage, scallions, cilantro, carrots, mango, crispy wontons and peanut aioli (with steamed rice). As this included all of my favorite flavors, I was a very happy (and full) girl.

We also tried the fish of the day which was local caught Tile Fish served with spaghetti squash, grilled broccolini and lemon almond sauce. I could eat an entire bowl of the spaghetti squash. When I make it at home, it is never this good. I have never had Tile fish before and really enjoyed it.It's a light white fish.

Next thing I know, dessert came out. I can never say no to Smores, no matter how much room is left in my belly. Toasted marshmallow and Chocolate bar with vanilla ice cream and caramel. Need I say more?

Everything we had was delicious. I will absolutely be back again. If you have yet to dine there, I urge you to go give them a try!

The steamed soup dumplings are heaven in a steamed basket!  The service was quite friendly.  The siu mai was fresh and had great flavor and textures.  The chive and pork dumplings were right on the money and pan fried to perfection.  They also had a new menu item of pan fried soup dumpling with black sesame seeds on top.  This was a party in your mouth.

There are 3 sauces at the table which mixed together are sublime on all the dumplings.  The vinegar is perfect on the soup dumplings.  

If you've never had soup dumplings remember to eat them while they're hot and put it on the soup spoon and add your favorite sauce on top.  Eat it one bite and make sure you don't burn yourself. 

As for the roast duck over rice.... reminded me of eating in Hong Kong at night time with some greens on the side a little roast duck nicely seasoned with 5 spice powder on the bottom which gets into the white rice that the duck sits on.

ordered the matcha and black sesame swirl soft serve in a cup (the combination of these two flavors are amazing. bitter and nutty combined. i think the matcha flavor is great but i dont think the black sesame is as good as other places ive been too, could be more flavorful or taste less grainy. they give a huge amount I couldn't finish it.

you get 2 free toppings of any choice. they didn't have the charcoal vanilla when I went and had hazelnut instead which sucked. also, maybe it's because we went late at night, it looked like they were sparse in ingredients, and the place didn't seem as clean or tidy. maybe also the all white interior and empty walls, except the menu board, in this huge place doesn't really make it seem cozy or make you want to stay, looks too cheap and plastic. other than that, I would recommend coming here for the matcha ice cream for cheap after eating some greasy Chinese food",2017-10-30 20:47:26,Kuriimii,1023 Cherry St,Philadelphia,PA,39.9547891,-75.1569208,"Food, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt"

I didn't have the opportunity to go to either on of those restaurants, so actually eating dinner in what was a former church was a whole new experience for me.

From top to bottom, this place is just divine. I love the fact that the restaurant is situated in a ""reworked"" church, and still has the feel with the stained glass windows and high ceilings. The atmosphere is cozy, yet elegant and everything is just beautiful. The staff here might be the friendliest staff in town. I know that some of you might say it's because the place is so new, but I was greeted by multiple people when I arrived, a few staff members stopped by during dinner to inquire about the meal and I got a friendly goodbye on my way out the door.

I started off with the #gooddecisions cocktail as I looked over the menu. Everything here sounds so amazing, and I like that they have a nice selection of options from seafood and pork to chicken and vegetable dishes. For my appetizers I got the 3 cheese plate which came with the chef's choice of cheeses as well as the rabbit rillette, which is basically a pâté, The cheese was delicious- I wish I could remember exactly what the cheeses were, but I really enjoyed them. The rabbit rillette was out of this world. It was full of flavor and a biscuit came on the side so it could be spread. It was really rich, and if I was just getting a drink and an appetizer here, this is exactly what I would order.

For my entree, I got the whole smoked fish, charred eggplant, house yogurt, eggplant & black sesame seed purée. The fish is indeed a whole fish which comes with the bones in and head on. It was delicious! The fish had enough meat on it that the bones being in it wasn't a problem at all and they were fairly easy to ""pick out"". The fish had a smoky flavor that was good without being overwhelming. The eggplant was perfectly roasted and the yogurt was a nice touch and mellowed out the flavor of the fish a bit- it was a nice balance of flavors.

I loved my experience here and I am excited to return.

I figured with all the not so stellar early reviews including how limited the menu is, how could they spread it over to dinner?  But we passed by while in Fountain Square and saw their chalkboard out front with a dinner special listed, so we stopped in before a show at Radio Radio.  This is a cool looking spot-- narrow, industrial, minimalistic. Counter service but food is brought out to you. Drink options--bottles in the fridge. The dinner menu was written on a large spool of brown paper hanging behind the counter.  Agree that prices seem pretty high for what's offered. $6 for 4 thin dumplings. $8 for 2 hand-sized Vietnamese pancakes. and the dinner special---congee? really? you can make a dinner entree out of that?  I didn't actually see it, but when I think congee, i think of garlicky/bland soupy white rice that you eat when you're sick or hung-over (or very pregnant like the lady in front of us). 
The wild mushroom dumplings were quite good--obviously handmade with what looked like only mushrooms inside, but pretty flimsy. The sauce had a tad too much vinegar for my taste.  We shared the non-vegetarian Vietnamese pancakes. At first I wondered why they were not just called Korean pancakes since most of the ingredients were Korean (bulbogi beef and sauce, kimchi), but they were definitely not Korean pancakes (juhn)--they were more like tacos on a little crepe (and topped with pickled shredded cabbage and fresh cucumber slices, not really kimchi). I guess the sauce was bulgogi inspired, not quite the same. It also had a little spicy kick. Husband quite enjoyed them. We also shared the Korean noodles ($12). Surprise! It's cold. And more like a noodle salad or maybe a cold noodle bibimbop--short udon noodles tossed with chili paste sauce and topped with pickled Asian pear (I thought they were radishes), fresh cucumbers slices, soft boiled eggs, and sprinkled with green onions, black sesame seeds ( I don't even think I noticed the baby bok choy or Thai basil).

I knew this will be sweet overload, so after my birthday brunch in center city we decided to walk here from 13th and Walnut. Arctic Scoop is on E. Passyunk near 13th St. It is a small store with very limited seating. Fortunately, when we went we were the only customers so we grabbed the only table that will seat four people. Soon after that more people came in. 

On their menu board you can see the ice cream flavours, toppings, etc. When we went they only had about 6 flavours, but I thought that was enough. I really wanted to try their lychee lavender ice cream, but I didn't see it. Workers will happily let you taste different flavours, so after tasting pandan I knew I wanted that. My daughter ordered black sesame, and I thought it tasted good, but for me the flavour was a bit too intense. I think from few years ago Philly has caught onto selling egg waffles, but all the egg waffles I have seen sold around here are kind of expensive. I am used to paying $1 - $2 in SE Asia, so definitely a sticker shock. However, if you like egg waffles Arctic Scoop does a good job. 

I think Arctic Scoop truly serves good ice cream with great customer service. All the workers are really friendly and helpful.

The soup dumplings are delicious. 6 to an order, there are regular pork ones or pork & crab ones. Personally, I don't think it's worth it for the upcharge since you don't get much crab. 

We've also tried the garlic baby bok choy and it's normally very good, but the last time we ordered it there were a couple pieces that looked questionable - but they were the last few pieces on the dish so we just left it. Something to be mindful of though.

Was also told to try the Dan Dan noodles but I found it kind of bland. Others have tried the lunch special (fried rice, ginger beef and a spring roll) and they also said it was pretty flavourless.

I like the soup dumplings a lot, but haven't found anything else to be super mind blowing. I do love that they give you free dessert! The last few visits we've received sesame balls filled with black sesame and they were delicious.

I ordered 1/2 matcha and 1/2 taro soft serve in a cup, topped with oreo crumbs and condensed milk ($5, large enough to share for 2 people). They also had a smaller cup option for $3.50. Pretty reasonable $ - maybe in response to earlier feedback that this place was too expensive.

The perfect presentation practically had me drooling, but as I tried the first few bites, it was just...okay? Not overly sweet, but not as creamy, flavorful, or dense as I've had before. I was also sad not to see black sesame, a flavor that's popped up in a lot of Yelp reviews/photos and part of the reason I was drawn here. The topping bar also looked surprisingly sparse. 

Although the treats here lend themselves to super cool, drool-worthy photos, there's some cost-cutting corners that don't make this place a hit in my book. Sparse topping and flavor selection/quality compared to other places (plus, I barely received a few drizzles of condensed milk on my $5 ice cream), donuts advertised on the chalk board that weren't there, something off about the interior design and location in Chinatown that makes it difficult to want to linger (if you can, given the limited seating), understaffed service (only 1 employee making soft serve 1 at a time on a Friday afternoon). Maybe I came at a bad time, but this was right before the weekend crowds are supposed to roll in. 

Kuriimii is a unique soft serve spot in Chinatown with lots of potential. The beautiful Insta-worthy photos already draw first-timers like me in, but it'll need to set the bar higher to bring me back. Hopefully they do, because I would return WAY more often in that case!",2018-04-13 21:43:02,Kuriimii,1023 Cherry St,Philadelphia,PA,39.9547891,-75.1569208,"Food, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt"

We started with the ""Lost in Translation"" and ""How We Mule"" cocktails. The former's blend of mescal, agave, absinthe, and both Angostura and grapefruit bitters was good, but the absinthe could be dropped. Its strong, single note is mostly a distraction ($12). However, the mule is one of the best cocktails I've ever tasted. The familiar mix of vodka, lime juice, and ginger beer was dramatically elevated with a muddle of housemade blackberry-jalapeno jam ($10). Sweet, tart, zesty, and pleasantly spicy.

We followed drinks with an order of coconut prawns ($10). The coconut and panko-encrusted shrimp were served with housemade orange marmalade and pickled radish on the side. Overall a bit too sweet for me, but the shrimp were tender and the radish provided a nice contrast.

Next, a serving of pork belly spring rolls stuffed with cilantro, pickled carrot, jalapeno, kimchi, hot and sweet mustard, and above-average peanut sauce ($8). Every bite was was a delight. Equally good, a plate of bibb lettuce poke wraps filled with fresh hamachi, housemade green sriracha, black sesame seed, bean sprout, cilantro, and lime ($12). Fresh and tasty.

Classic arancini are small balls of risotto stuffed with ragu, peas, and mozzarella, deep-fried in Italian bread crumbs. This chef's take is a simpler mix of risotto and peas, deep-fried in panko and served with a creamy gouda sauce ($4). The bacon-enhanced sauce was a must, as the rice seemed a tad overcooked and the seasoning was mild-to-missing. I'm thinking perhaps the chef purposely went bland with the morsels in order to showcase a knockout sauce.

Still unsated, we ordered a pair of memorable entrees. First, a sizeable bowl of fancy mac and cheese made with cavatappi pasta, jack, cheddar, and smoked gouda cheeses, bacon, and golden cherry tomato ($14). I've tried a lot of classy takes on this favorite--and I've made a few at home--but this is something else. The spiral pasta is fun, the blend of cheeses work well together, but the savoriness of bacon combined with sweet tomato is what pushes it above and beyond. A side order of house-pickled vegetables turned out to be an excellent counterpoint ($4).

Finally, a dish of the sort that makes you wonder where it's been all your life. I've grilled and smoked elk, made sauces and stews with it, enjoyed elk sausage, and am generally a fan of the large cervine. I don't often write in flowery tones, so strap in. On this occasion, I was served one of the best prepared, best tasting examples of wild game I've experienced to date.

A double on-the-bone elk chop was cooked to a perfect medium rare, drizzled in a luxardo cherry demi-glace and set astride what was described as, ""lemon, fork-crushed potatoes,"" dressed with grilled chunks of asparagus and fresh sprouts ($28). The potato bites had a nice crusty exterior and pillowy interior, the hint of lemon adding an air of mystery. I can't remember when I've had asparagus done so expertly. The sauce was a perfect complement to a perfectly cooked piece of high quality meat. I took my time and savored every bite.",2017-07-07 00:24:59,Washoe Public House,275 Hill St,Reno,NV,39.5223954869,-119.8148554978,"Bars, Beer Bar, Cocktail Bars, American (New), Nightlife, Restaurants"

I'd heard great things about the dining experience at Ciccio's/Water, and knew my group was in for a treat as soon as we sat down.

We had to start off the night by trying out one of their signature drinks: Slamgrias! They are enormous fishbowl glasses filled with white or red sangria...as well as a miniature bottle of red wine, white wine, or champagne. We ended up sampling one of each between the four of us...you know...for scientific purposes...All three varieties were fruity and tasty - they're definitely a party in a glass, and the presentation is very fun! Definitely order one up if you're dining at Ciccio's/Water!

Meanwhile, a few appetizers were arriving at our table! We sampled the tuna bruschetta, which was not only beautiful in color, but delicious in taste! It contained pistachio crusted seared tuna on a crisp crostini with edamame hummus. If you know me, you know that I am VERY new to the idea of eating sushi/raw fish. I have to say: this appetizer was absolutely delicious!!!! The balance of flavors and textures worked wonderfully together in the perfect bite. Yum! We followed that with a sampling of filet quesadillas, their Almost Gluten Free thin crust pizza (the crust is craker thin and crunchy - I was personally a fan), the chicken marsala pizza, and a big bowl of lobster baked macaroni and cheese with truffle oil. Now there's a taste treat! Not only was the mac n cheese rich and creamy, but you could definitely taste the tangy kick of truffle oil in each and every bite. It's definitely an indulgence...so I'm glad we were all sharing! An enormous plate of sushi was also presented on our table, and I was SO excited to try everything! Yep - two experiences with raw fish in this meal...and I LIKED IT! Can someone pat me on the back? On the top of the plate was the Diablo roll (which I am pretty sure was the favorite around the ENTIRE table); it contained Ahi tuna, tempura onions, and was topped with spicy tuna, beet tobbikko, daikon sprouts, sriracha aioli, and sesame seeds. To the left was the Sleepy Hallow: it contained spicy Ahi tuna, cucumber, mango, avocado, and was topped with zesty spicy aioli marinated Maine lobster meat, black sesame seeds, beet tobbiko and tempura spinach. If you like sushi, the selection at Ciccio's/Water is so unique! There were quite a few rolls on the menu that I would have also liked to try, but I guess there's always next time...right?

We weren't done yet, though! My friend Megan and I decided to sample a few of the martinis on the menu. I ordered the Zen cosmopolitan (made with sake instead of vodka) and Megan opted for the cucumber martini (refreshing!).

Then, we soldiered on to taste two entrees: first was the Thai chicken bowl. This was my personal favorite dish of the evening, and I wouldn't be surprised if I ordered it on a return trip. It contains chicken, napa cabbage, scallions, cilantro, carrots, mango, crispy wontons, and peanut aioli, with a scoop of sticky rice. It was crisp and fresh, and not at all heavy. I loved the balance! We also tried the fish special, which happened to be tile fish on that day. The tile fish was served on top of a bed of spaghetti squash and broccolini, with a lemon almond sauce. Again, the flavors and ingredients were fresh and flavorful. And it featured spaghetti squash...one of my favorites!

We thought we were done at this point in the meal, but we were wrong! A bucket arrived at our table...with a huge sparkler spewing fire from it! It was a shot bucket...sent for special occasions. Talk about presentation! And dessert was absolutely necessary, right? That evening, we could not resist a s'mores inspired option. Be still, my heart. I didn't want to share...I wanted one of these bad boys all to myself. It featured a toasted marshmallow and chocolate bar with vanilla ice cream and caramel. I don't think you can go wrong with any of these ingredients, and I'm quite sure that the dessert was devoured by our table in about 10 seconds flat.

All in all, I could not have been happier with our experience at Ciccio's/Water. If you're in the South Tampa area, definitely make sure to head in and give them a try - they are open for weekday lunch, dinner every night, and feature a brunch on Saturdays - so many options!

It was that impressive.

We showed up around 8:45 and put my name down for our party of 4 since it was a full house (including a full bar without much standing space). The hostess kindly suggested that we could go to this other bar a block away and she'd call us when the table is ready. We took her advice and had a few drinks at New Wave (a nice neighborhood spot), and about an hour later got the call our table was ready (they reserve it for you for the next 10 min).

We were so hungry we ordered up a storm. Unfortunately I got lazy with picture taking so didn't capture all the food we ordered.

Ordered:
-Tuna mentaiko (tuna, fluke, spicy cod roe, sesame seeds, sesame oil, soy, scallions)
-Spinach gomaae (spinach, black sesame sauce, sesame seeds)
-Chashu buns (pork belly, scallions, cucumbers, some combo of mayo/soy ginger glaze)
-Hamachi Kama (grilled yellowtail collar)
-Saba shioyaki (grilled mackerel)
-Grilled squid
-Salmon/avocado sushi roll 
-Chirashi 
-Some yakitori plate with shishito peppers, ginkgo nuts, bacon scallop, chicken and something else I'm forgetting. I'm angry at my friend for not sharing the scallop w/ me.
-Takoyaki 
-Eggplant (I think glazed with sweet miso per the menu I found online)

Everything was tasty and well executed. Some of my favorites were the tuna mentaiko, chashu buns, and the yellowtail collar. The other grilled options and both our sushi orders were excellent as well.

I loved the decor, a mix of fun Japanese touches with the anime playing on the wall and cute candles lining the wall behind the seats, with the wooden bar that has more of a mature look.

Pricing is reasonable, especially considering we ordered 4 carafes of sake (menu also boosts a respectable sake collection).

Previously located on Airport Road, it closed last November with a promise of a return in the new year. The new year has come and their new location was next on my long list of eats.

You'll find Shanghai 456 at 14456 - 118 Ave, just further north of Telus World of Science. Whether or not they intentionally looked for an address that included ""456″, I found it pretty amusing. Don't bother trying to find a sign that actually says ""144 St"" though because there isn't if you're heading westbound on 118 Ave. It's right on the southwest corner, intersection of 145 St and 118 Ave. It didn't help at all that the sign was a measly unlit square overshadowed by the banner. Perhaps too soon to say, but if that's all the signs that are going up, I suggest you just spot the blank red store front banner to locate it. Parking available on the west side of the building, as well as in front of the restaurant alongside the smaller road.

Compared to their location before, the number of seating seems to be the same, with the only improvement being that it actually looks like a restaurant now instead of an old cafeteria of Edmonton's city airport! Fair warning: something is up with their floors. Just that particular tile, or perhaps just a coincidence that both Sharon's and my boots were sliding along with no grip. Slick! Be careful, especially if you have wet shoes or heels!

Of course, we ordered the xiao long bao. Glad to say that the quality have remained as they were! Nicely wrapped by a thin dough and lots of soup! Prices have increased though to $7.50 per basket of 6, from their $6.95 fare. A small cost when you consider their new location must have higher rent.

A new dish that I haven't tried before at Shanghai 456: the house special hot and sour soup, as per Sharon's request. Normally I'm not a fan as most that I've tried are too sour for my liking, but this version was a good balance of spicy and sour. A really good portion if you ask me, with lots of tofu, chicken, and vegetables. I would definitely order it again!

Not wanting to order just regular xiao long bao, we ordered the ones with crab meat to change it up. I prefer the traditional dumplings, but these would be a great option for any seafood or crab lovers. Packed with real crab, the flavor definitely overpowers the pork, which could be a good thing if that's what you were looking for.

Complimentary dessert is standard at Shanghai 456, or at least it's always been every time I've been there. This time it was freshly made black sesame pastry. The pastry was crisp and flaky, with the black sesame filling being not too sweet. Absolutely loved it! You can order it if they're offering a different dessert for the meal as well, Lotus Blossom, $3.50.

Verdict: It's the same place as it was at its previous location. So for those who have sat in the old cafeteria and experienced the original Shanghai 456, expect the same but with slippery floors, and a more restaurant-like feel. For those who have never tried, you're missing out on some great Asian comfort foods. My only qualm about this place is the service. When it gets busy, it literally becomes a standstill. I understand that the dumplings need to be freshly made and steamed, which could take a while especially if each table is ordering most likely more than one basket, but there must be a better way to get those bad boys out! We arrived for lunch on a Monday at 12:30pm. Our first order of xiao long bao didn't come to our table until 1:20pm (that's almost an hour folks!), as did our hot and sour soup. Last to come was the crab version and by the time we finished, it was already 2pm. My apologies to Sharon for such an extended lunch hour although we both knew what we were in for. It was a consolation that the owner did come out to apologize to each and every table and thanked them for waiting, but dining experience would drastically improve if they could find a way to bang those little dumplings out.

The coffee soft serve is really good. Very strong coffee flavor. I personally am not a fan of the charcoal flavor. Besides adding grainy texture and black color, it doesn't taste like anything and the vanilla base flavor is less milky and more sugary than my tasting. Next time I want to try the other flavors!

I have to give credit to the owner. He came over as I was about to throw away the rest of the waffle cone to inquire my feedback. I was honest about the cone being stale and not crispy.

Both times (Friday night and Sunday afternoon) were busy with most of the tables filled. The new place is a slight upgrade from their previous digs but I personally miss the old hole in the wall vibe (not that the new place is bad, I am just nostalgic for the old).

Anyways, for food this is what we tried:

Trip #1
- Xiao long bao ($7.50) - you get 6 delicious, juicy soup filled dumplings. Dip it in the sauce, take a nibble and suck up that juicy fillings. Nice and tender. So good!  Definitely try them if you've never had them before.
- Steamed vegetarian dumplings ($8) - these were tasty as well. Nice amount of filling and you get 6 plump dumplings.
- Golden chinese baguette with condensed milk ($3.50) - first time I've had this. Basically, a small baguette and you dip the bread into the condensed milk. Sweet but don't think I would get this again.
- Lotus blossom ($3.50) - a pastry filled with black sesame paste. You get three. Not overly sweet which i liked. Nice as a small dessert.
- Shredded pork and cabbage noodle soup ($8.50) - we didn't even finish this (shocker!) but it's your typical noodle soup with some meat and veggies. 
- Complimentary dessert - mango pudding. Perfect way to end the meal.

Trip #2
- XLB's ($7.50) - excellent as always
- Wor tip ($8) - beef fried dumplings. This one has soup in it too! Didn't try it but my friends devoured it. Ask for the chili sauce if they don't give it to you.
- Minced pork with spicy sauce on noodles (jar jiang lo mein) ($9.50) - a bit on the salty side (my friend had this before and it was even more salty) but is pretty tasty.
- Green beans with X.O. sauce ($12) - so simple and yet so delicious. Garlic, salt, and a bit of dried shrimp over green beans. Awesome! Could eat a whole plate of this myself.
- Salt and pepper boneless ribs ($12) - came out piping hot along with some stir fried onions and green peppers (watch out for the red chili peppers). I liked it but one of my friends thought it wasn't crunchy/deep fried enough. I agree it was a bit on the greasy side.

Having taken over an old neighborhood bar, it is right on the corner.  It has a full bar and then a small dining room.  Because of the size, they do not take reservations.  I understand but it can be tough for a crowd.

The restaurant is casual but refined.  They have white walls and lacquered wood tables, so there is no distraction from the food.  The staff is very friendly but the service is a little uneven.  Fortunately, we didn't have to wait too long for things.

The food, with the exception of dessert, is exceptional.  It was surprising that the dessert was such a letdown, but I recommend skipping that and ordering something wonderful like a Manhattan from the bar.  The food is truly worth the trip.

We started with the Braunschweiger, which was a perfectly seasoned pate of pig liver made in house and served with dill pickles, pickled red onions, aioli, brown mustard and grilled bread.  It was the best that I have ever had - it was best simply with the brown mustard but the pickled red onions were also a clever pairing.

The marinated flank steak and charred broccoli were the two dishes that were the most ""as expected"" of the evening.  The charred broccoli had a bit of grilled lemon but could have used a bit of salt.  I appreciated that it was crisp and served warm.  The marinated flank steak was well seasoned and finished with excellent blue cheese and housemade onion rings.  How could you go wrong with such a combination?

The 3 cheese sandwich with tomato soup blows your mind.  It is the most incredible tomato bisque that is finished with blue cheese crumbles and slivers of scallion greens and black sesame.  This is supposedly a mere accompaniment to the sandwich, but it is the reason that the sandwich is worth ordering.  Not that the grilled sourdough sandwich with sharp, white cheddar and blue cheeses, chopped portabellas and roasted peppers, and marinated artichoke hummus is not incredible - it is.  But it is other worldly after it is dipped in that soup.

The smoked pork belly with a sesame soy glaze over cauliflower puree with crunchy green beans is also impressive.  The pork belly is moist and tender, and the cauliflower puree is perfectly smooth and creamy.  The green beans add a sweet crunch and the sesame soy glaze adds a little nutty sweetness.

The smoked mushroom risotto is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  Order this dish!!!  Incredibly creamy risotto with just the right toothsomeness is loaded with smoky, meaty mushrooms and lots of herbs.  It oozes richness.  The crisp broccolini on top are also al dente and add a nice freshness to the whole dish.  I was blown away.

We knew we needed to order dessert, because the food was so incredible.  Alas, the train derailed.  The butter poundcake was on the dry side, even if I liked the housemade strawberry sauce or the fact that it would have crunchy edges from the cast iron dish.  The apple cobbler was just boring apple mush without a lot of imagination.  The rich chocolate brownie was just this side of dry so it was saved by the wonderful cream cheese frosting and the drizzle of chocolate sauce.

We had a great time at 58hundred and expect that it is among the best that St. Louis has to offer.  I am rounding up from 4.5 stars, but that 3 cheese sandwich and soup is WORTH THE TRIP and the round up.",2019-07-07 00:08:04,58hundred,5800 Southwest Ave,St. Louis,MO,38.6071764,-90.2857131,"Bars, Cocktail Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, American (New), American (Traditional)"

My boyfriend wanted to order the Pumpkin Spice swirled with Charcoal Vanilla. However, we were informed they did not have Charcoal Vanilla that day - a huge disappointment, given that this is one of their biggest selling points. Also, it was about 1-2pm on a weekend, not the end of the day or anything. My boyfriend ended up ordering the Pumpkin Spice and Taro instead - surprisingly, not a bad combination. We got condensed milk and oreo crumbles on top. Taro is great, it's light and not overly sweet, without an overwhelming taro flavor, would recommend. Hard pass on the Pumpkin Spice - it's way too sweet, we were sick of it after a few bites.

I ordered the Black Sesame and Matcha swirl on a chocolate cone - I've been drooling after similar soft serve pictures on Instagram for a couple years now. I opted for strawberry Pocky and green tea Pocky as toppings. This did not disappoint - I'd highly recommend this combination. It's definitely not too sweet, and I think people that generally don't like sweets would enjoy this dessert. Black Sesame and Matcha is a match made in heaven.

I wasn't expecting Kuriimii to be cheap, since it's obviously a trendy spot, but it's a bit hard to justify $5 for a cup and $6 for a cone. Unlike some of the older pictures, toppings are NOT unlimited anymore - you get 2 toppings with each purchase, additional toppings are 50 cents. As y'all may know, ya girl is a fan of unlimited toppings; I think it's an easy thing to offer at little expense to the vendor and great joy to customers. They have a great selection of available toppings, so I really hope they return to offering unlimited (or at least 3, c'mon) toppings soon.

Maybe my expectations are high, but I think Kuriimii is going to have trouble keeping up with the soft serve trend AND competing with the existing hoards of Chinatown ice cream shops if they don't make some changes. I don't think I'd choose this place over Teassert, A La Mousse, or T-Swirl. That being said, I'd return for the Black Sesame and Matcha swirl if I was craving it, and to try the Charcoal Vanilla - hence 3/5 instead of 2/5.",2017-10-30 08:38:37,Kuriimii,1023 Cherry St,Philadelphia,PA,39.9547891,-75.1569208,"Food, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt"

I've tried the Taipei special, the boyfriend special, and one that we made ourselves (black sesame, red beans, grass jelly, condensed milk & wafer sticks). 

The matcha and the taro were both really good and full of taste, whereas the black sesame base is a little more subtle but still yummy. Great texture of shaved ice that is Taiwanese style & the 1 extra free topping for checking in or liking on FB is an awesome deal. I really love the wafer sticks as they add a great crunch and taste to the texture of the shaved ice.

The price is also really good, considering how much these would go in NYC or in Koreatown in LA (although maybe that's not a fair comparison :P)

The food is amazing. My husband had the best lobster bisque here (he likes to think hes a lobster bisque expert) It has a Asian twist (coconut milk and curry paste I think) which makes wonderful flavor. Sushi is also amazing, or my husband says so coz I dont eat sushi ( yes, I am ashamed as an Asian) However, I strangely love their sunrise roll. Its cooked and fried. Its so good that I forgot its sushi, they cheated a little by the drying lol. I love the rib so much but its definitely messy, not for a first date. Our favorite is the lobster tempura, which is discontinued. Its not just goood because it is lobster but more about the aioli/sauce and black sesame. Afterthat, nothing is the same again. They have beautiful presentation. 

For entree, we tried the Sampler Trio, Bone in Ribeye, Filet Mignon, and Lobster. Our favorite is the ribeye with truffle mac and cheese with BACON. The best dessert is hand down the souffle. It is not quite the same as other souffle I have. Its more like lava cake and very chocolatey. The rasberry sauce and vanilla bean compliment the dish so well. I burned my tongue twice because I was too excited and ate the hot lava as soon as it oozes out.

A cone with unlimited toppings (including pocky, various cereals, toasted marshmallow) will set you back $7 which is a bit on the steep side but for the amount of ice cream and the quality of the flavors, it was worth it!

Tuna guac had huge tasty chunks of fresh tuna that we mixed with the avocado mixture and that wasabi oil. I didn't want that dish to end.

We also got a salmon roll, shrimp tempura roll, and a kitchen special cold silken tofu dish, which I wasn't a huge fan of thanks to an interesting herb or floral taste.

I love Hong Kong style shaved ice, which is more of an ice cream with finely shaved and creamy texture than the Italian cousins. The only downside is the cost, which a small (while sizable) portion is quite expensive, even with all of the trimmings. I love the green tea flavoring of taipei and thought the grass jelly added that extra texture. As for the king of the north, you can't go wrong with the black sesame, but I think the vanilla cookies could have been exchanged for something less sweet. Unfortunately, 'kiss me' was the most bland and I did not have much love for the original flavor.

But sometimes it's hard to have all the right ingredients on hand AND the motivation to chop a million vegetables before they start to grow mold. That's where CoreLife Eatery comes in, a new whole-food chain that recently made its way to Indianapolis in the Castleton area. They claim to be non-GMO and locally sourced with no high fructose corn syrup or artificial colors and flavors and their branding looks like a bright Chipotle. Similar to other fast-casual restaurants that are worming their way into Millennial's hearts and pockets, the restaurant offers grain, salad, and broth bowls that can be customized into a myriad of healthy offerings.

This might sound a little complicated, but it's basically like building a big salad. You pick an already-decided combination from the hanging board or design your own dish, adding things like tuna poke, black sesame seeds, and chopped almonds on top of quinoa and kale. Most bowls have a suggested dressing, which have been prepared fresh, in-house the same day. The chain also offers creative, hand-crafted beverages, such as beet lemonade or apple cider green tea.

CoreLife Eatery was really clogging my Instagram feed, so I decided to give it a try last Sunday with Husband in tow. It was pouring down rain outside, so we ran into an almost empty restaurant (sharp contrast to the lines out the door from the previous week) to see what all the fuss was about. The verdict? Underwhelming. I tried the Tuna Poke grain bowl with miso sesame ginger dressing and Husband ordered the Thai chicken with rice noodles and Thai cashew dressing. My bowl looked pretty and colorful, but became super soggy with too much dressing and the flavors all muddled together into a bland mess after a few bites. Husband's bowl was pretty bland and he was disappointed with the cold noodles and overwhelming amount of cabbage. Both bowls needed some salt or spice or something. There was also a super weird 1/2 slice of store-bought bread that accompanied my dish as a ""side,"" but no other side options (I need my kettle chips!). I sampled almost all of the fruit beverages and was very let down with the taste and sweetness without finding any favorites.

I like so many ideas from CoreLife Eatery, like the protein-rich bowls, antibiotic-free meats, and pretty affordable entrees (around $10), but there has got to be a way to make them more palatable. Husband ran to Wendy's an hour later. If I went again, I would order something different and definitely ask for dressing on the side.

The crust has that burn that comes only with being cooked in an extremely hot oven, and the toppings are beyond excellent. (I should also add that Anello doesn't have an extensive menu.)

The normal retail for this tasting menu was $140 - so that's a 50% savings. So when I noticed the deal was about to expire, I decided to finally get off my butt and cash it in! 

So I made reservations for a Saturday evening. I called the day of the dinner as I needed to move back dinner by an hour, and it was a good thing I did. For some reason, they did not have my initial reservation down. Perhaps that was why I never received a confirmation call, despite making my reservation 3 weeks in advance. Regardless, they were able to provide a table for me that night.

Sushi Zento offers the talents of Chef Sam Ho, former sous chef at Morimoto, of Iron Chef fame. Having tried Iron Chef Morimoto's cuisine at his NYC outpost, I was excited to try Chef Ho's cuisine.

Unfortunately at Sushi Zento, there is no sushi bar (just a normal bar). Still, I was informed that omakase (traditional japanese tasting consisting primarily of sashimi/sushi/nigiri) was available. Still, one of the perks of omakase is being able to watch the sushi chef expertly prepare the nigiri right in front of you.

The decor at Sushi Zento is intimate. I loved the exposed brick and the wax coming from candle-lit openings on the walls. Still, the seating was reminiscent of Barbuzzo - in other words, really close quarters.
 
Tasting Menu ($70 pp)

Pumpkin Spice ($10)

Hiram Walker pumpkin liqueur, Hanger One spiced pear vodka, Cointreau orange liqueur, simple syrup agnostura bitters, garnished with fresh ground cinnamon 

While the Living Social deal offered free non-alcoholic drinks, we decided to opt for a few cocktails. The GF went with the pumpkin spice, which was light, subtly sweet, and frothy. 

Johnny Sokko ($10)

Muddled ginger, Bacardi rum, Coca cola, garnished with fresh ginger root and lime wheel  

Mine was sweet as well, with some definite bite from the rum. However, I didn't notice any fresh ginger root garnish and the carbonation from the Coke was slight.

Miso Soup with Mussels

We both started off with miso soup with mussels. There was balanced salinity in a typically overly salty soup. The scallions were a nice touch and the sweet, plump mussels were perfectly clean and juicy.

Crispy Calamari Salad

I could smell the crisply fried calamari before I ate anything - and that was a good thing. The calamari was light and was a nice highlight to the perfectly dressed greens, which had a prototypical ginger-sesame dressing. 

Homemade Crab Cakes

The crab cakes were crisply fried in panko - perfect pucks of meaty crab. There was a slight amount of sweet, garlic tartar sauce on each disc and some greens to break up any monotony.

Whitefish Carpaccio 

The whitefish was thinly pounded out - light and toothsome. The accompanying sauce was smoky and bright, rounding out the dish nicely.

Chicken Teriyaki 

The chicken breast was juicy and was seasoned lightly. The teriyaki sauce was saccharine and pretty standard. Frankly though, the spinach was my favorite part of the dish, especially as I'm usually not looking to get the teriyaki dish at a sushi restaurant.

Sushi/Nigiri Platter

We received white tuna (escolar) sushi with avocado. This had a slight mayo dressing, which was creamy. Topped with black sesame, this was pretty good. Next, we had amberjack (yellowtail), which had a nice delicate snap. The salmon was prototypically fatty and delicious. The super white tuna (fatty escolar) was smoky. Maguro (tuna) was fishy to me however, and was quite disappointing. A pet peeve of mine is when the wasabi is served on the side with nigiri and that was the case here. Additionally, the rice was substandard for sushi - cold and I could barely sense any vinegar.

Tofu Cheesecake

Our first of our dessert duo was the tofu cheese cake, with lychee in the middle. This had a creamy panna cotta-like texture and was subtly sweet. 

Mochi with Green Tea Ice Cream

This was the GF's first time trying mochi and she wasn't the biggest fan, mainly due to the texture. However, being used to mochi, it was perfectly dense and smooth. The green tea ice cream within was a nice palate cleanser for the meal.

Overall, I can't see the tasting at Sushi Zento being worth $70 per person. Heck, the tasting at Jose Garce's restaurants consist of more overall dishes, higher quality, and better creativity. However, thanks to Living Social, the price point justified this initial meal. Still, I was expecting a bit more though I may have been misled by the guise of Chef Ho's experience at Morimoto. While Morimoto isn't a pure sushi/sashimi/nigiri experience, the quality of the fish is still quite high. And the cuisine offered (do try the Duck, Duck Duck at Morimoto) is simply superior. I can see the uninitiated being enthralled by Sushi Zento, but I would come here for a stiff drink and a specialty roll.

The decor, music, and theme was so unique and fun. My friends and I came here for happy hour and had a pretty good experience. I ordered the spiked agua Fresca, which was very refreshing and light. We all shared the fried wonton chips which were addicting. The three salsas all tasted great and it was a fun app. Nothing mind blowing but it was a unique twist to the traditional tortilla chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp and black bean tostada, which all my friends agreed was the best thing on the table. Filling, fresh and delicious. The beer battered fish taco was good, but very fried. The mushroom taco was also good, but extremely greasy and left massive residue of straight grease. Get the black sesame flan! Not too sweet and very addicting! 

Two things I didn't love. No food on the happy hour menu. The waitress told us the happy hour special, which were wings for $14. Sounded more like special of the day because that does not sound like happy hour prices. At least lower the price for the wonton chips during happy hour. Only other thing was this restaurant was supposed to be Mexican/Chinese inspired. Not much Asian influences. Not sure how any of the tacos had Asian influences. I thought the flavors would be more of a fusion, but it's more of a fusion of concepts.

The Lark may be the best in town. It's certainly my go-to recommendation whenever friends visit Santa Barbara. 

We'd been wanting to go back ever since we got vaccinated in April, but predictably, it's almost always booked up during reasonable hours. Our dinner, at 8:45 on a Monday night last month, was a special treat, and we enjoyed every minute.

We ate indoors, and the space and service and atmosphere were as we remembered, all very pleasant and exemplary. The Lark's bar is as much of a draw as the food, and I loved both of the cocktails I ordered. The Yankee Point was a lovely daiquiri, made with Wray & Nephew, Denizen white rum, lime, strawberry, and sumac. The Summerland was a beautiful, balanced sour, with Old Overholt bonded rye, Amaro Averna, summer peach, lavender, and lemon.

The food was delicious. We started with oysters on the half shell and the bigeye tuna crudo, both outstanding. The oysters came with watermelon granita, finger lime, and basil, and the tuna in a cool, spicy fermented Fresno chile broth with black sesame, stone fruit, and Thai basil. The next thing to hit the table was a board of Mary's free range duck liver mousse, served with saffron apricots, spicy Iranian pickles, and olive oil crostini. This was a lavish portion of rich, flavorful duck liver mousse with a colorful variety of pickles, which is always what I want with my charcuterie. Grilled Caledonian prawns were meaty and succulent, prepared with black lime, tahini yogurt, cilantro zhoug, compressed cucumber, and mint. Don't sleep on those juicy heads. The centerpiece of our dinner was the grilled prime hanger steak. The steak was perfectly cooked, a rare silky red through the middle, sliced and served over a platter of blistered shishito peppers, smoked beef tallow emulsion, sungold tomato, and crispy Thai basil. We had some vegetables left over (since Matt doesn't eat many vegetables), and I had them with salmon later in the week and they made that easy at-home dinner feel positively luxurious. For dessert, we shared an olive oil cake with jam, peaches, nougat, and ice cream. The least memorable part of our meal but still great.

We had a stellar time at The Lark and can't wait to come back, hopefully before four more years have passed. It's never disappointed us, and I don't expect that it ever will.",2021-11-15 23:25:57,The Lark,"131 Anacapa St, Ste A",Santa Barbara,CA,34.4148777,-119.690279,"Nightlife, Bars, Cocktail Bars, Food, American (New), Desserts, Restaurants"

There is seating available both inside and outside, though I prefer the inside because the atmosphere is so welcoming. It's dark, it's mysterious, and it's a great intimate setting for a dinner with friends, family, whomever! Our server Billy was so knowledgeable and helped us with recommendations on our first trip in. The cocktails were delicious (I LOVED the Cherry Blossom) and there were tons of sake options to choose from (though I had no idea how to even begin with sake so didn't go there). 

Ok, so good. Some stars of the show included: grilled avocado, spinach gomaae, tuna guac, sashimi combo, corn special, duck buns, friend fish buns,  hanger steak, chirashi bowl, and wagyu roll.

This is the place to go for soft serve ice cream. I've tried the matcha, black sesame, taro, and some of my favorite rotating flavors were watermelon and honeydew. Honeydew was the best flavor of all time and I'm crushed that it's gone. I sampled charcoal vanilla out of curiosity once and it tastes just like vanilla, nothing special, but seems like people get it for the novelty. I saw a girl eating charcoal vanilla once and all her teeth were stained black and it was quite the sight to see. 

The staff is friendly and you can sample all the flavors you want before making your final choice. I usually get a cup with 2 flavors side by side (I don't like when the flavors mix together in the swirl), almost always with taro. I find the matcha to be a little bitter and the black sesame a bit grainy. Then you get 2 free toppings of your choice- I like the Oreo dust and green tea kit kats, or the mochi for an extra $1. The cost is only $5 for a sizeable portion that can be shared between 2 people. My boyfriend and I always leave this place feeling satisfied.

I would see the Japanese-imported fish, the live softshell crabs, the tuna etc etc and I have been planning to visit for a while. Only thing holding me back was that you cant put a reservation, you simply have to show up and see what's available.

This restaurant did not disappoint. The place was full and vibrant on a Saturday night and we only had to wait for 15mins before we were seated. Concerning drinks, I decided not to go with their Sake, and I went for their Japanese-influenced cocktails instead. My Okinawan rum cocktail was very-well balanced and very tasty.

We then proceed to try an assortment of different dishes and flavors. Our  hot pickles showed up first and they were crunchy and tasty, the slow braised pork belly came up next, and the bun was fluffy and the pork belly tender and complex. The kewpie mayo made a difference here, adding playful notes to the palate. The Japanese eggplant was another plate we loved

Of great interest was the hanger steak that I have actually read about in one of the Philly Inquirer's articles on some of the best steaks in Philadelphia. The steak is marinated for hours before served and you can taste this japanese-inspired flavor profile.

Our menu then proceed with the sushi part of the menu: Two rolls of sushi and the Chirashi bowl. The shrimp tempura roll had one of the best tempuras I have ever tried, and the soft-shell crab was very interesting as well.

The Chirashi bowl was so fresh you could smell the sea in every bite. An assortment of fatty tuna and lean tuna, king salmon, japanese mackerel, California uni and salmon roe, the Chirasi has an amazing value considering how tasty and fresh the fish is.

We concluded our meal with the black sesame panna cotta  with the black sesame adding a compelling saltiness and complexity to this dish.

I would surely go again and again to try other elements of their menu.",2021-12-23 09:28:51,Royal Sushi & Izakaya,780-782 S 2nd St,Philadelphia,PA,39.9380805,-75.1465231,"Nightlife, Restaurants, Dive Bars, Izakaya, Bars, Sushi Bars, Japanese, Pubs"

I love my (ok, our) city, and I love to see it thriving and gaining so much attention for our amazing food culture. That being said, Anello is such a perfect fit into what is becoming an excellent corner of downtown. As of Saturday evening, there was still not a sign on the outside, and the gorgeous wooden front door is your only symbol of entry. As we ate, I saw a few people through the front window who were walking around the block searching and they would stop and realize they had arrived, turn around and come in with a relieved look on their face to find that around 5:30 pm the restaurant had not filled (yet). 

We arrived just after Anello opened at 5 pm to find the restaurant was not full yet (I somewhat expected it to be, as it's Saturday and they are still new). We had our choice of seats and took the table closest to the door. The space is quite minimal, with simple, yet well-constructed wood tables that are bare wood, unpainted/unstained. The front door and ceiling are gorgeously simple flourishes. The lighting is wonderful- bright enough to see clearly and yet not harsh by any means. The entire aesthetic is a quiet modern and the design statement clearly wants you to think about the flavor of your food without imposing any personal belief upon you. 
We were happy to be left with only the responsibility of tasting our food.
We began with the simple roasted/grilled seasonal vegetable. A whole zucchini split down the middle, served piping hot and drizzled with olive oil, lemon juice, and seasoned with salt and pepper. Sprinkled all over the zucchini were pistachios. The whole dish was so flavorful, and there was nothing overdone, no pretentiousness. Just a real plate of food we shared over a good conversation with glasses of wine. 

Oh and let's take half a step backward and talk about the menu, shall we? Concise and poignant, with real ingredients. No fuss. 

For our second appetizer we ordered the wood-fired foccacia with house-made cheese. This was so good, my husband commented on how fast I ate my half. This is funny because I am the pokiest, slowest eater you will ever meet. There was plenty of cheese on the side for us both to get our fill without feeling like we needed to be careful to share and to have enough for our bread. I felt like that was worth noting. Our pizza came out, perfectly timed about 2-3 minutes after we had finished our appetizer and had a moment to savor what we had just eaten. I really felt like it was due to the fact that the chef could see where we were at in our meal with the kitchen being open and at the head of the space. Its kind of a big deal when a restaurant capacity is small enough that you can give your customers this kind of service, and it was noticed by us throughout our entire experience here. 

We ordered the Bianca and added Italian sausage. The Bianca at Anello has chiltepin on it, which is a small red chile native to the Southwest (it grows wild in Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas). We both felt so happy with our pizza. The chiltepin gave some good flavor and a satisfying warmth to our pizza without being overwhelming. (I would encourage people who typically don't like spicy foods to give this a try. I feel you would be pleasantly surprised at the flavor of this!) The rest of the pizza was perfectly flavored and seasoned. The crust is deliciously pillowy and perfectly wood-fired with a wonderful amount of crunch. Overall, we were in food heaven throughout the entire meal. For dessert we ordered the black sesame with anise gelato and the flourless almond cake, both of which were so good we want to eat them again and again. 

Lastly, the service here was spot-on, 10/10 fantastic. Our server knew which red wine to recommend and indulged us by geeking out with us a bit about how good the food was. We would have come back just to have this level of service, even if the food was just pretty good. But lucky for Tucson the food and the service are EXCELLENT.

Cons: hard to eat in the container because I was afraid the toppings would fall off. The bubble waffle was not as crisp as I thought it would be. I guess u can't expect crispy due to the ice cream when I have had it before the Hong Kong bubble waffle was crispy but this was a totally different location.

Came here on a Friday night date night for a some sweet indulgence. The shop is cute and right in the middle of all the East Passyunk hustle. It's not too hard to find and the crowd that gathers around definitely serves as a pseudo street marker on spotting it!

Inside it's brightly lit with the days ice cream options displayed towards the left and the register to pay meets you as you keep walking forward. The menu has some great, and unheard of to me, options. This really tickled my curiosity. 

We chose to go with the black sesame flavor in a black vanilla cone with the dark chocolate chips - all black errrthannnggg. The other flavor we grabbed was pandan (a fruity tea leaf flavor) in the same type cone. 

Both options were so good! The flavors were truly infused throughout the frozen treats. Definitely something new and delicious! 

The workers were great in explaining the different flavors and answering our questions. Unfortunately, due to COVID, they were not offering tastings of the flavors. This definitely had us a little uneasy since these flavors were so new to us, we were unsure if we will enjoy. Thankfully we were pleasantly surprised!

The tomato gazpacho was good, but it had a fairly stronger tomato base than I would want. Smells like vomit, but that's usually how those things turn out anyways.  

For the fancy radishes, the smoked tofu had a bold smoke, with a spicy aftertaste. I'm glad they used extra firm tofu. The smell of roasted black sesame was divine. 

The radish with the Shishito pepper was a different take with the sesame. Instead of black and smoked, it was green with that distinct pepper flavor. The purple radish on top of pickled cucumbers were not what I expected. Instead of bright, vinegar notes, it felt more like cucumber noodles with radish meatballs. The cucumber take this refreshing taste, while the sesame seeds gave it body. There was this umami taste that was there that I liked.The Yusuf avocado was such a good match! The tutu brought a floral tartness that was light handed, while it sat upon the elephant of mass that was the low toned body of the avocado. I wish I had thought of it myself! 

The leek tart was a little more conservative than I thought, but it was still
a decent dish. I liked the black garlic jam that came with it. I wish there was more of it. They don't put much on the plate. This definitely was more a starch dish than anything. 

The smoked carrot is worth the price of admission. If you close your eyes, it taste and feels like a bratwurst! It makes sense with the shape and infused smoke in the carrot. The carrot kraut and carrot mustard were a great addition to the carrot theme. They didn't distract from the carrot itself, yet still added for the familiar dimensions to exist. The pumpernickel slice with mashed chickpeas didn't sit that well with my stomach as I was getting full. It provided an alternative taste of a Rueben. 

The strawberry sorrel bread pudding with saffron ice cream was a trip. What looked like some type of spinach quiche surrounded in a tomato basil soup, turned out to be a dessert. I'll have to admit, it took a couple of bites to fully appreciate it. Don't scarf this one down. After a while, it turns into a lemon shortcake, along with the strawberries and saffron poking out.  

At the end of the day, this was a great place that doesn't destroy the wallet, offers an elegant atmosphere, but feels like eating at home.

Food - I have never gone wrong with the egg bowl, burger & fries (i love their fries), savory oats, stout waffles, and country ham toast (this sandwich is HUGE and better than any other ham toast I've ever had). Everything is so flavorful, especially the savory bowls. I wish I could make these dishes at home, but I would never get the flavors to be as good, so I will never regret ordering these dishes here. Avocado shake is alright, not a big cup, but if you're craving and willing to pay, sure. I'm also excited to come back and try other sandwiches and the roze bowl too.

Drink - their drink menu is really extensive and I've only had the golden turmeric and black sesame steamers - both lovely. The right milky-ness and not sweet at all. Roze latte is pretty good. Made pretty with the rose petals on top of the drink.

Service - If you don't want to experience slow(er) and less attentive service, I'd recommend coming at off hours. I had one not so great experience, but made up by with a dish on the house.

It is the Nomiya Restaurant. This quaint little restaurant is nicely tucked between Yogurty's and Wild Wing. Parking is widely available but their restaurant has limited seating. If you have not been to it, it's high time you tasted some quality stuff. This isn't your daily Eat-All-You-Can restaurant because literally everything on this restaurant's menu speaks volume and taste. It has a mid-range pricing. Not too pricey that it hurts your wallet/purse. So, before you take a peek at their menu, please do yourself a favour. Wear a bib! You know you'll be drooling in no time with their many many impeccable offerings.

They offer quite a good variety of items such as ramen, donburi, appetisers, noodles, sashimi, sushi, salads, bento box and some pretty dessert to finish off the palate. The last time I was there, I had the Century Egg Maki for $15.50 which contains hamachi, salmon belly, and avocado with century egg sauce, tobiko, and green onion. Every bite was heavenly. What can I say? I even dream of it in my sleep and needless to say - that sweet tasty dream made me drool all night long. YUM! YUM! YUM! I also had the pleasure of trying the TAN TAN - Ramen flavoured with homemade peanut paste and spicy sesame, ground pork, peanuts, green onions, and nori. The ramen are served in a huge massive bowls. Enough to fill you up to the brim. For only $12? That is plenty of bang for the buck.

To finish off the palate, I joyfully picked the black sesame Mochi ice cream. This is actually made of pounded sticky rice with an ice cream filling that YOU do not ever want to miss. The texture just went perfectly well. They do have other flavours such as chocolate but I highly recommend going for the black sesame ice cream - only because the flavour works. 

The inner décor of this restaurant is clean and simple. Sticking true to the Japanese style with a nice little bar area facing the sushi prep area. I find this to be quite entertaining actually especially when for the super independent diners or a group of diners. There is always a comfortable cosy spot for diners from different walks of life.  

Nomiya Restaurant has definitely won a place in my top places for sushi in Edmonton. I give it a blazing 5 star for being so consistent with their service and the quality of the food. Needless to say, I will be back for more. What else are you waiting for? Now, go hungry and fill that belly up with some goodness of Nomiya.

The food:

Gyoza: liked the flavor of the filling, but the wrapper wasn't crisp/light

Tempura: beautiful presentation with light batter. Very well-done and great portion/variety.

Tonkatsu - Lightly breaded and tender cutlet. For its price, you get two cutlets worth of katsu, and I think the real treat is the katsu sauce with kewpie mayonnaise. Really lovely.

Sashimi regular- For $25, you get a 12-piece sashimi dinner. Extremely fresh fish, and I love the shredded daikon beneath. The salmon and the yellowtail were exceptional. Filling alongside salad and rice. 

Hamachi don- Again, beautifully fresh hamachi don presented on rice with black sesame. (Chirashi must also be wonderful)

I am looking forward to trying more of their traditional dishes, and I was very taken with their service. Absolutely a gem in Philly.

I've been meaning to start leaving reviews but nothing inspired me to take the time until the overwhelming whateverness that is Sakura filled me such foodie disdain. This is real beef. Sakura is the Biggie to my Pac. Sike. It's more like the Lil B to my Pac, meaning this food was wild corny and suspect. All I wanted was a snack so I thought I'd grab some dumplings. I walked passed Dim Sum Garden because I've been there too often so I figured I'd hit up the original DSG on 11th for old times sake. I wanted to grab some regular pork and chive dumplings, not even the soup jawns. That soup dumpling/xiao long bao shit is too Iggy Azaela now. Y'all really fucked it up. 

Anyway, I passed the new DSG and was on my way to hit the old DSG but right in between that walk is Sakura. I've lived in Philly all my life and Chinatown for almost 2 years now and always seen Sakura kind of busy but it never seemed to be my thing. It bothers me when Chinese places do too much and serve volcano rolls and shit. Leave that shit alone! Just do you, booboo! That's why I always steered clear of Sakura and pretty much any other place that does like every Asian food ever. That's a tip from an Asian guy, btw. Don't fuck with those thirsty ass restaurants. If they did one thing good, they'd stick with it. But they don't, so they compensate with variety.

Aight, so I thought I'd give Sakura a shot because I saw on their neon signage (another desperate ploy that should've been a red flag) that they had pan-fried Shanghai soup dumps. I've been craving the fried jawns recently, thinking back to last year when I had them in Shanghai at Yang's Dumplings. That shit was incredible and changed my life. I'll never look at a dumpling the same ever again. I let nostalgia get the best of me and I turned back and made my way into Sakura.

I ordered and the wait was wild long but honestly, you won't see me complain too much about service ever so if that's what you're into, you're looking at the wrong reviewer. I'll actually take bad service to the neck and sacrifice all that if the food is incredible. That's just how my priorities stack.

But yo, I was looking for something that resembled Yang's Dumplings in Shanghai and what I got was bread dressed up as dumplings for Halloween. This shit a couple weeks too early for all that. These thick ass, flavorless ass, soupless ass, dressed up with black sesame seeds ass dumplings were spongy as fuck and I was soaking them in ginger sauce just to give it some type of taste. I promise every bite I took pissed me off more than the last. I shook my head as I looked at these ""dumplings"" like they were my children bringing home bad grades. I wasn't even mad, I was disappointed. Nah, fuck that. I was mad. 

I'm going to wrap this up. I'm honestly wild into food and you'll see that from my upcoming reviews and my palate is actually on par with y'all pretentious Michelin star mother fuckers so when I say Sakura was booty butt cheeks, then that shit was booty butt cheeks.

The atmosphere is fantastic (especially if you are seated in a dining pod with buttons to change the colors of the lighting). I've come here several times and ordered quite a few menu items, but here are my favorites:

Cocktails: I love the Lemon Lotus (Tito's, sparkling wine, poppy seed tincture, lemon foam). Super refreshing!

Dinner: The Vegan Stephen roll (tempura zucchini, avocado, kanpyo squash, eggplant, roasted pepper) is amazing. My favorite part is that they arrange the vegetables to resemble fish - very creative! I also recommend the Japanese Eggplant (red miso, crushed peanuts, bonito); it is tender and delicious. 

Dessert: This is where the fifth star in my review comes in. I'm not ashamed to say that I've tried every dessert on the menu, but there are two standouts! The Black Sesame Cheesecake with Vietnamese coffee caramel and chocolate shortbread is absolutely fantastic.

The food at Pod is amazing and reasonably priced, if not underpriced. It is economical bliss.  I expected to pay way more and for appetizers, sushi, drinks and desserts for two. Our bill topped at $84 bucks. Not too bad. Killer ambiance and surprise after surprise, I find myself thinking about Pod time and time again.

Pod is futuristic, offers everything traditional with a twist and is unpretentious. The place is like an outer space playground with ever changing colored lights, bubble ceilings, and white on white interior. The sushi boat is a world of its own and if you fancy anime, the screens are like windows of cartoons.  I saw waitresses carry out birthday desserts with sparklers. It was like Fourth of July. The service is excellent (welcoming, accommodating, quick, and knowledgeable). Everything thumbs up.

The ultra hot weather called for mocktails, one Cucumber and Apple Spritzer and one White Peach and Mint Soda. Both were refreshing and full of fresh fruit. We ordered the special Lobster Ramen appetizer, Tonkatsu Sandwich, and the Rockin Spicy Tuna. The Lobster Ramen was not soupy but had a creamy rich broth-like dressing. The lobster chunks were huge and tender, the vegetable medley offered crunch and the ramen was very fresh and not over cooked. The Tonkatsu Sandwich could easily rival David Chang's pork steamed buns. The Rockin Spicy Tuna was haute sushi. Sprinkled with black sesame seeds and prepared like little works of art, the spicy tuna was like a sushi hors d'oevre. It was topped with popcornlike tempura rock shrimp and microgreens. This all created for a filling meal but without hesitation we ordered dessert.

If Pod's tactic to get people to order dessert was to send in a tattooed dessert man instead of our friendly waitress, then it surely worked. We were set on Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate (chocolate toffee bread pudding, chocolate shot with salted rim, and chocolate tart) but when the tattoo guy told us about the special Chocolate Flan we had to make our dessert choice Chocolate times 4. The tattooed guy was evil in a good way. Death by chocolate all the way at Pod. No worries, you will live to tell the tale of sweet decadence. I could easily devote a whole review to these desserts. Instead, just trust the smile on my face that they were all exquisite. I will add that the Chocolate Flan was light rather than rich and was complimented by an Early Grey Tea coulis and black cherries.

I'd make a two hour trip to Philly from NYC just to indulge at Pod. It was really that good.

My father treated me to dinner here after my college graduation. Of course, I went all out for the grande degustation menu with wine pairings for each course since it was the only event in my life that justified the price tag. If not now, when? I've outlined all the courses I was served below. I don't know shit about wine, I just drink it, so I don't remember what they all were can't really comment on them. If you're curious though, about a half-glass was served with each course, so I was QUITE tipsy by the end of it.

The courses were as follows:

Amuse Bouche: Tuna Tartare w/ Daikon
-Light and a perfect way to start the meal. I love any kind of tartare, and this was no exception.

Bread & Butter: Rolls w/ Milk & Chives, Onion French Bread, something else
-I only tried the onion but it was very good. The waiters kept bring the tray of bread around and I think my brother had about 10 pieces.

Raw Oyster w/ Caviar & Hibiscus Foam
-Absolutely perfect. It had been a while since I'd had an oyster and this one did not disappoint. The hibiscus foam was especially interesting - more fruity than I expected.

Salmon Tartare w/ Vinegrette & Essence of Lavender
-Another tartare! Perfect. The presentation on this was very interesting. The bowl sat on a plate filled with dry ice, then the server poured liquid (the lavender essence, i believe) on it at the table. I actually don't really like the smell of lavender, or anything very floral for that matter, but it didn't detract from the dish.

Foie Gras w/ Risotto Chip, Black Sesame, Berry Sauce & Cherries w/ Ice Cream
-Possibly the most creative of the dishes. On one side of the plate was the foie gras and risotto chip, and the other side had a scoop of ice cream (possibly kirsch flavored?) with macerated cherries. The sweet components and salty/rich foie gras were the perfect foils for one another.

Some Firm White Fish w/ Consomme and Zucchini Blossom
-I can't remember what the fish was, but it was cooked perfectly and delicious. Served in a shallow bowl of consomme with a tempura-fried zucchini blossom on top - nice and light.

Lamb Tenderloin w/ Crispy Potato
-Lamb is one of my favorite meats, so this was an obvious winner for me. The crispy potatoes were like a classy version of that old vending machine standard, Potato Stix - but obviously way more awesome.

Taglatelle with Porcini & Truffles
-The simplest course, with just a few beautiful ingredients. Pasta, butter, porcini mushrooms, salt, pepper, some generous shavings of truffles... that's it.

Melon Sorbet w/ Powder (palate cleanser)
-My least favorite course, but I'm biased because I hate all kinds of melons. I tried a bite and then let my dad eat it.

Cheese Tray
-This was awesome. A server came out with a gorgeous glassed-in cart containing about 10 different cheeses. You're allowed to choose as many as you want, but they recommend about 5 for a nice-sized tray. I told the server I liked soft, strong cheeses, and he made up a beautiful assortment with some grapes and 2 kinds of bread. 

Dessert: Yogurt Sorbet, Lemon Macaron, & Tomato Confit
-The first of quite a few desserts. Served in a parfait glass with a dollop of tomato confit at the bottom, the lemon macaron balanced in the center, and yogurt-flavored sorbet on top. 

Dessert: Truffles
-I was served a platter of 5 truffles: mixed nut, tarragon, saffron, curry, and red beet. The unexpected flavors were all quite good, but the saffron and curry were my favorites. I was also given a cute box of 2 chocolates to take home.

Dessert Cart
-Yes, the famous dessert cart! It was every bit as wonderful as I had hoped. I asked for a small slice each of the Grand Marnier Souffle, the Flourless Chocolate Cake, and the restaurant's Signature Chocolate cake, which consisted of rum-soaked genoise with rich chocolate buttercream. Unfortunately, by this point I was pretty full, and all the desserts were so rich I could only have a few bites.

Finally, we were served a variety of petit fours with the check.

This is really extravagance, but for a special occasion it can't be beat. The service is impeccable and treat you like royalty even if it's painfully obvious that you don't belong (like my frugal and tactless grandmother who loudly exclaimed ""It looks like a roach!"" when the amuse bouche was served).

We ordered the black sesame base, with lychee mix in but disappointingly, all three topping options we wanted were out (blackberries, raspberries, and mochi) so instead we just went with Kit Kat, blueberries and lychee, and then we got the condensed milk drizzle. The thing cost ~$7, and we waited about 15 minutes for it.

Overall, I can't say the whole experience was exceptional, but it was still good. The ice cream was definitely tasty, and there was a good amount of it, but for $7 there were literally two pieces of Kit Kat, 3 blueberries and maybe 3 pieces of lychee which seemed a little scarce.

xdKOpEysmegHAPEL_uHN6Q,lAW03ccfMEuRZiDqvVgc0w,E8CBQWDoCK3WujyMFfVG2A,5.0,2,0,3,"Came to Chop Steakhouse and Bar (downtown) last night for Downtown Dining Week 2016 and to celebrate the hubs and my 13th Wedding Anniversary.

We opted for reservations which meant the booth areas upstairs but the walk-in space in the lounge downstairs is probably my favourite here.

Our server and all the staff were pretty fabulous.  Sure there were some mistakes - missing a spoon for soup or water but when asked everyone was super friendly and took care of our needs.  I really liked how any staff member walking by was able to stop and check in on us or ask if we needed anything and our server checked back at the perfect times to make sure we were enjoying our items.

Parking can be a bit tricky here but the East Parkade in City Centre is pretty good and has an access ramp from the 2nd floor of the parkade (still requiring some stairs) that doesn't make you go outside in case it's super cold or rainy.

I absolutely love the look of this location of Chop and you can really see the attention to detail what went into the huge renovation of this space for Chop to open up paired with the Sutton Hotel.

If you haven't been to the lounge - go - it's really something to enjoy.

Anyhow, I digress.

The hubs and I opted for the following from the Downtown Dining Week $28 Menu (there was also a $48 option with killer appetizers like steak bites and crab cakes but we didn't want to have a huge meal at a late setting before bed):


For starters we selected:

Mixed Green Salad
garden vegetables, pumpkin and black sesame seeds with basil honey-lime vinaigrette

Red Pepper Bisque
creamy satin bisque of tomatoes and roasted red peppers

Both were excellent but the basil honey-lime vinaigrette was TO DIE FOR.  Seriously, I wanted to lick the plate and asked the hubs if he would try to replicate this at home!  PHENOMENAL salad and the pumpkin and sesame seeds were just killer with it!

For mains we selected: 

Maple Bourbon Haddock
blackened haddock, seared in a maple bourbon butter, served with wild rice pilaf and fresh seasonal vegetables

Top Sirloin
served with your choice of wasabi infused mashed potatoes, wild rice pilaf, baked potato, Chop cut fries or fresh seasonal vegetables


& I added lobster and gorgonzola for $5 to the Sirloin

Both were excellent.  The steak was cooked to perfection at a warm medium rare.  I loved the lobster and gorgonzola add on!  The hubs was super happy with his blackened haddock.

Both of us commented that we would order the same starters and mains again which is always a great sign!

And for desserts we opted for: 

Tiramisu
espresso soaked sponge, amaretto & mascarpone mousse, shaved chocolate

Warm Apple Crumble
granny smith apples & raspberry compote, brown sugar crumble, vanilla gelato

Both desserts were excellent and presented beautifully.  I loved the classic feel of the crumble in the oval cast iron dish and the tiramisu in a 1/2 size mason jar.  I've had mason jar desserts before that fell flat or didn't seem put together at all.  This one totally hit the mark and was not a consistency I was expecting in that it didn't appear to have layers and felt more like a mix - similar to rice pudding.  The flavour was heavenly and easily rich enough to share between two people.

I had mentioned at the very beginning of dinner that I had a walnut allergy and not only did our server come back several time stop to ask specific questions but the front end manager also stopped by to clarify before delivering the apple crumble to my husband - even the way the front end manager knelt down to our table to discuss my allergy with me at eye level was quite comforting and made us feel that they really cared.

Being that we had a late seating and it was a work night we opted for sparking water instead of wine or cocktails and I was pleased to see that they offer house bottled sparkling water with a little note on the back of the bottle that choosing to support this method is both environmentally responsible and sustainable.  And the price was fair at $3.99 a bottle (2 glasses plus a little extra from each bottle).

To finish off the night our server brought us two glasses of prosecco because she had overheard us talking about our Anniversary.

All in all it was a fabulous meal from service to ambience to presentation to taste of food.  It's not often that I can say I would 100% repeat the same meal bite for bite but I would definitely say that about Chop downtown.

TWO THUMBS WAY UP

As a side note, I had come here back in November as part of the Yelp Rodeo Week food crawl and was absolutely blown away by the food we tried and the knowledge and service we received from Stefan (the sales and special event coordinator).

The salad is a tasty combo of mixed greens, diced tomatoes & peppers, dressed with black bean corn salsa, a dollop of guacamole and served with a side of homemade Hawaiian BBQ dressing. The dressing, with a ginger base, is excellent and enhances the combination of flavors without overpowering.  We chose BBQ chicken for a little extra protein.  This adds a big portion of shredded chicken, lightly flavored with Hawaiian BBQ seasonings.   A really good salad! 

We also tried the Maui Poke bowl. This is made up of a generous portion of imported-from-Hawaii Big Eye tuna, diced & house-marinated.  The tuna is served with diced tomatoes, mixed greens and pickled cucumbers, then garnished with sliced avocado and black sesame seeds. All of this is added to a bed of sticky coconut jasmine rice.  One of the better Poke bowls I've had - no frills but super fresh ingredients and the right proportions make this one shine. 

Honorable mention for using all biodegradable plates, bowls & forks.  Dinner for two with soft drinks is $24.

There are a few other mouthwatering options on the menu. I'll definitely be back.

I live about 30 minutes away from Bobacup, so it is no easy feat for us to get here. I mean, if I didn't have a two-year-old I'd consider coming a lot more often, but there is only so much Disney+ I can handle when trying to keep him from losing it during an hour round trip ride. 

However, hands down, this is one of the safest experiences when getting food. You put your order in online in their incredibly robust ordering platform, park in the parking spaces in front of the building, they walk out with a whiteboard with numbered names of orders, you hold up your finger with which number you are and then they come back with your order. The employees wear masks. Phenomenal.

The ordering platform is top notch. It gives you all the options that you would normally get in the store. I'll have to ask my friend Chris W., if he is able to get his standard order, which isn't on the menu, but if you are a normal Bobacup goer like the rest of us, you should have no problem getting what you want. (Seriously, if you want your mind blown you should go see how many check-ins Chris W. has at Bobacup.)

I got a split cup lavendar and matcha with honey boba. Honey boba is their version of boba and it is free in June. I only mention this, because Brett N. decided to forgo free honey boba, because he didn't realize that meant the normal tapioca balls. Yes, feel free to make fun of Brett N. for this. We also got 13 mochi ice cream (if you order 10 you get 3 free. We actually ended up only getting 12 because they forgot one of ours. Since it was a ""free"" one, I wasn't that upset about it, but check your order before you leave!)

For the mochi ice cream, we got salted caramel, thai tea (which is a new favorite of mine), matcha (always good), chocolate, ube (which isn't a flavor I'm that familiar with so I had to try it. It was good, but I'd probably keep going back to the thai tea) and black sesame (which ranks up there with thai tea for me, so good). The drinks are always on point, so I really enjoyed my lavender and matcha bubble tea. 

I'm kind of lucky we don't live closer or else I'd possibly be matching Chris W. with my visit numbers (probably not, but I can dream). If you are worried about your health during COVID-19, this is a great place to get your bubble tea fix.",2020-06-21 18:43:04,TeaStori,2732 E Fowler Ave,Tampa,FL,28.0557460623,-82.429274,"Food, Bubble Tea, Restaurants, Desserts, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Cafes, Asian Fusion, Tea Rooms, Macarons, Specialty Food, Juice Bars & Smoothies"

-The dungeness crab puffs were pillowy and flavorful.
-The octopus was tender and the cavatelli with santa barbara spiny lobster while cooked perfectly al dente could have benefited from more kick.
-The whole branzino was moist but the scallops were OK, not great.

There are is an all-gender bathroom available for customers, and the walls are decorated with polaroids of customers who are posing by their ""bench"" with a cute little corny slogan on top such as ""Love you to infiniTEA"" or ""Guilty AF"". They also have a little Tea wall, where if you are unsure about what to order, you can open the cans up and smell the essence of them. If you are still unsure what to order, you should ask the employees. I did that the first time I came here and I've been getting the same thing over and over again! (P.S. It's the Royal Milk Tea). Throughout the years, they have also been adding more and more things to their menu, such as food items, Taiyaki ice cream, and the mochi ice cream bar (which are little pockets of ice cream, covered over rice dough. I highly recommend the black sesame, my favorite). They also have different sorts of toppings, such as the teddy bear jellies, heart jellies, or mini boba. I usually get the regular honey boba, which I am never disappointed by, each time I order this. Some other places, the boba can get too chewy or too hard if you order at a certain time, but not Bobacup. 
Now, on to the drinks.

A while back I gave Sushi Village a try and was seriously unimpressed, especially at the price. But it's been two or so years and Groupon had a deal, so I figured I'd see if things have improved.

First I ordered the only option they had for sake, a small, generic hot sake. I swear I heard a microwave running behind the curtain to heat up my sake. Right after my sake came the standard ginger salad and miso soup. The ginger dressing on the salad was abundant, which was nice. The soup was lackluster. It tasted...off. Something wasn't right, like maybe the mix they used was expired?

For an appetizer I ordered tuna tataki, which I hadn't had in a while and decided to treat myself. Take a moment and Google some images on what that dish should look like before you read my description of what I was served. My place was a half dozen pieces of tuna laying flat and spread out. Rather than the outside rim being seared, which means a large piece of tuna was seared and then sliced, each slice had some very mild searing on the surface. Uneven searing at that; it didn't look like it came from a heated surface, maybe from a brulé torch. Rather than the regular ponzu sauce they were drizzled with a weird, this yellow sauce, almost lemon in taste.

Usually when I get sushi I'll order chirashi. It wasn't on the regular menu but the waitress said it was on the lunch menu but they would be happy to make it. When it arrived I was again disappointed. In the continuing theme the portions were small. For $15 i got three small slices each of tuna, salmon, white tuna, and something that looked like maybe amberjack. The sashimi portion was ok, but nothing special. The seasoned rice that is part of chirashi was a tiny amount, no more than 1/3 of a cup, probably enough to do three or four nigiri. Rather than season the rice it was just sprinkled with black sesame.

After eating what should have been a filling meal I was still quite hungry. I decided to finish my order with a volcano roll. Every other place I've ordered this roll it's been four large pieces of snowcrab roll as a base then piled high with tempura, snowcrab, and sriracha mayo. What I was served was a base of small California rolls with a small pile of Krab, tempura, and a dab of spicy mayo. 

The entire meal was disappointing. I don't think I'll be coming back.",2013-07-17 19:54:24,Sushi Village,3535 Severn Ave,Metairie,LA,30.013678,-90.158498,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Restaurants"

First of all, the restaurant is very small. I've looked in during the day, and it looks beautiful (lots of rose and rose gold, of course). At night, it's so dark in the restaurant that you kind of lose its beauty. (I'd probably try Cafe Roze again for brunch before I'd try it again for dinner.)

We had a reservation, which worked out because the restaurant was pretty much full. (There wasn't a traditional hostess stand when we entered, so we waited until someone came from around the bar to seat us.)

We started with the miso cauliflower (with Lebanese yogurt, salsa verde, and black sesame), which was good, but nothing I'd insist on ordering again. 

My husband got the pork schnitzel (with caraway, red cabbage, pickled beet, and sauce gribiche). While this dish was okay, there were several things I didn't love about it. I thought the pork was a little overcooked. Then, I didn't love that the beet and red cabbage were raw and tossed with overdressed greens (possibly the beet greens). I love a slow-cooked, caramelized cabbage, and the beets/cabbage combo on this plate ended up being vegetables on the plate that you force yourself to eat - a side salad rather than an accompaniment to dish that made sense. The sauce gribiche wasn't my favorite thing either. Overall, not a dish I loved.

I got the simple pasta with tomato, garlic, anchovy, and Parmesan. Now, this is the kind of dish I could eat every night. Homey, comforting, simple, and delicious. When you make something this simple that could be made at home, it has to be kind of perfect to be worth the money that you will spend in a restaurant. And this dish was just about there. I thoroughly enjoyed. Transported to childhood good.

We also shared one of the desserts they were offering that night: tapioca pudding with vanilla syrup and bruleed grapefruit. I wanted a lot more grapefruit and for it to be more bruleed (and a little less of the syrup), but I liked this dish. 

We also got a couple of drinks each. My husband tried the Shelby Park Swizz (mezcal, genepy, St. Germain, and pineapple) and the Melon Drama (gin, aperol, melon). He liked both, but preferred the Swizz. I got the Roze Fashioned (Old Forrester Signature, amaro, and rose water), which I liked, and then a glass of wine. 

The service was okay. Definitely on the slow side. Our waitress forgot to put in our dessert order, so it never came until she looked at us and wondered why we were still there (and put it in then). But they comped it, so no complaints there. 

I want to be clear: this was a not a bad meal. But in Nashville, where the upscale food scene is so competitive, this meal just didn't impress me compared to other restaurants where we'd spend approximately the same amount of money. It was okay, but it's not a restaurant I'd rush back to.",2019-02-19 22:57:30,Cafe Roze,1115 Porter Rd,Nashville,TN,36.1885313,-86.7290353,"American (New), Restaurants, Bars, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Cocktail Bars"

Rolled ice cream has really blown up over the past couple of years. Originating in Thailand, rolled ice cream rolled it's way over to the United States. The first established rolled ice cream shop in the United States was located in New York. Thankfully with much achievement and high demand, ICE NY opened a shop in Philadelphia and several other locations. I just had to check it out!

Step 1: Pick your ice cream flavor & your toppings.

Flavor: 
Thai I-CE Tea
Banana Pudding
Chocorilla
Cookie Spree
Mango Sticky Rice

To-Taro
Ca-Ti Coconut
Black Sesame
OR CREATE YOUR OWN!

Toppings: 
Candy
Cookie
Brownie
Fruit
Cheesecake
Marshmellow
Pocky
and more toppings...and a bunch of sauces!

Step 2: POUR POUR POUR, SMASH SMASH SMASH

Watch staff pour the ice cream mix onto a cold metal place. Staff use metal paddles to quickly break up toppings you ordered to mix into your ice cream. This is the fun part!

Step 3: The final product.

If you could not tell already, I ordered the Cookie Spree ice cream. . . and I am SO happy with my choice. It was incredibly delicious with all the ooeey gooey brownie, oreo, and chocolate sauce. This was by far the best-rolled ice cream I have had in Philadelphia. I have been to several other places in the area, but what makes ICE NY PHILLY different is that their ice cream is very rich and creamy. The ice cream had a thicker consistency which really made it stand out. I can also say I was stuffed after eating this treat.

Staff was very welcoming when I first walked in. They were super helpful especially with this being my first time at ICE NY PHILLY. They were able to give recommendations and state which rolled ice cream cups were their best sellers. It was fun watching them make my ice cream treat and getting to know the staff. Not only does ICE NY PHILLY have rolled ice cream cups, but they also make rolled ice cream sandwiches. An ice cream sandwich is definitely something I would like to try next time. I wish it was acceptable to go back again tomorrow for another ice cream treat, but I will most certainly be back in the near future to cure my next craving at ICE NY PHILLY.",2018-03-07 15:11:37,I CE NY,1016-1018 Race St,Philadelphia,PA,39.955391325,-75.1566101418,"Restaurants, Food Court, Food, Desserts, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt"

Guess it was on the early side as the restaurant was packed by the time we were done.   The menu selection is limited but the dishes are interesting.  The service was very attentive and prompt.  

We started with the pork belly and the octopus.  The octopus is a better dish, a little charred and very tender.  The pork belly only had 2 cubes of the belly so you will get a nibble if shared as an appetizer.  The ribeye was the priciest item on the menu (they offered a tomahawk steak for $120 that was off-menu).  It was tender and prepared perfectly.  The branzino was good, served whole.  I'm not a big fan of this fish and this dish didn't do anything to change that.  While served whole, the bones were not really a factor though. My least favorite was the pappardelle with venison.  It was on the saltier side and the venison was not very tender (maybe that's how venison is).  

We also had to try the black swan dessert.  The presentation was stunning, and with taste to match (almost).  If you like black sesame, the black sesame ice cream is pretty awesome.
